Its easy to use and it offers speed dating every Thursday. however, I wish some of the features were more personalized or offered as add-ins. For example I would like the option to pay for bee-line (allows you to see who likes your profile) without having to pay for a full subscription like premium or boost. Other than that, the app itself is fine. The biggest problems you ladies (straight cis-gender) will run into isn’t really the app’s fault. After you match with someone, you’re given 24hrs to message them and they only have 24hrs to respond. A lot of times, guys don’t respond at all. You’ll also run into men who are just looking for hookups, which is typical. The other issue is the never ending one-sided small talk. A lot of these guys can’t hold a conversation or they expect you to do all of the work because bumble requires women to initiate the conversation. If your goal is to land a date in person, it’s going to take some patience, unless of course you’re a super model or something. Overall, its always ideal to meet ppl in person, but I think Bumble is a safe platform to explore your options. Use this as a supplement for your dating routine. Don’t solely rely on Bumble',\n",

       "  'review': 'When will they figure out how to make swiping work? Literally just scrolling very slowly and suddenly it likes a person. Or often the reason I’m scrolling is someone caught my eye and I want a closer look. Swiped no out of nowhere without swiping no! Horrible. When you’re at the end of a instagram feed and you try swiping to the next page it swipes no. They didn’t think that one through. You have to click the last pic then swipe the no aka left to see the next pics. Literally only Bumble has problems with the most basic part of a dating app that they all offer. \\n\\nOkay so don’t get me started on the actual purpose of the app; dating. That aspect is imbecilic, girls have to talk and wont. They’ll give out their details and you say so what happened? Oh I don’t check it when I match. Okay but you literally don’t understand the app. Useless app for that. My real complaint is purely as an app. It’s really bad. Name one other app where simply scrolling randomly changes to the next or previous page out of nowhere. It’s frustratingly broken. Even being super cautious. And for years now. If y’all can’t make the app work rewinding swipes should just be available for like/dislike. Like hey somehow we’re the only app that can’t get the basic function of scrolling to work literally the most important part. But we’ll sell you a very expensive bandaid to wrap around the glitch while hiding people to swipe on every 5 people for the day. Yeah weird advertisement guys.',\n",

If I am not interested in somebody, I do not change my mind simply on the fact that they’re interested in me. That’s not a healthy way to start a relationship, and it’s an obvious attempt at a cash grab for Bumble. That's not a feature that helps any user, because the info isn’t offered until after you’ve already swiped left, at which point you have to pay if you wanted to take advantage of the feature. Either they believe you should be with somebody just because they like you even if the feeling isn’t mutual, or even more likely, is they don’t really care about being a platform to make positive relationships and they just want your money. Stop insulting our intelligence Bumble\\n\\nUpdate: now bumble has a feature where they take your most attractive potential matches (people who already swiped right on you) and show you that they’re your potential matches, but they don’t let you swipe right on them without paying money. Worse than that however, these greedy mfers put those potential matches I’m assuming all the way in the back of the people you’d swipe through normally, so you won’t come across them, and if you want the match you have to pay. Shame on you bumble, this is why you’re losing. You prey on your customers emotions, going as far as making better matches more difficult, in order to leverage more money out of the customer.\",\n",

Want to see who likes you? Pay. Want more than 20 likes a day? Pay. Want people to actually see your profile? Pay. Want to use filters for your search? Pay And not a little either, as much as $30 per WEEK. If you don’t respond to your match within 24 hours (you know, if you have any kind of life and aren’t glued to your phone), the match will expire and, you guessed it, you have to pay. You even have to pay just to say “nice smile.” Just way too much to pay with all of the quality free apps out there.

Their opt out option seems full of odd and manipulative legal-ese.\\n\\nEDIT: I’ve deleted this app. It’s terrible. I have a life other than bumble, so I’m done with their “24 hour rule” which, of course, you can PAY to get around this rule they say is “so important.” If it’s so important, why can you pay to defeat it? I’m also deleting because I’m traveling. I’m not looking for a hookup, and I want to keep my location in my hometown. If I want to do that however, guess what? I have to pay. To heck with this terrible greedy company. Take other sucker’s money, you’ll never get any of mine. Hinge, OkCupid, and even Tinder (even TINDER.)',\n",

What I mean by this is that if you end up liking someone or someone (or that person) likes you, in order for you to see who that is or for it to be an official match, you must pay $18 just to see who they are that liked you, which is really unnecessary and expensive if all you’re trying to do is meet someone, and god forbid it’s someone you don’t find interesting or doesn’t match your personality, then you’d end up just blowing $18 for no reason when the whole point was just to meet someone YOU thought was perfect for you. And on top of that, the women have to make the first move (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing), but some don’t make a move at all after matching (from what I experienced). So it then makes it unclear as to whether they even meant to do that in the first place or not, and since I (a male) can’t say anything first, I’m just left in the dark as to why I haven’t heard from anyone cause I can’t say anything to confirm if she’s willing to meet. Im not trying to complain or say it’s a bad app or anything cause it actually does what it’s supposed to do, but I’m just pointing out the flaws of paying an expensive price just to see who swiped you and whether it was worth the money or not and also pointing out the communication issues between people.',\n",

The site is decent aside from the forced pop-ups asking for contributions and “social causes.” I recently was looking into a subscription for the site and had the incorrect one applied to my account. My first inquiry for assistance was closed without any response and when I tried to follow up they said the matter was resolved and they wouldn’t response to my email. When I opened a second case, although I shouldn’t have had to in the first place, I received a general response with absolutely no details or personal reflection of my inquiry simply telling me I can purchase the additional subscription for the additional cost, which wasn’t even what I was inquiring about in the first place. You’d think for a site that prides itself on its users and highlights a CEO who makes billions of the site, the customer service would be somewhat adequate to answer the concerns of the users in a timely manner. However that is far from the reality of this app and it’s customer service. Would highly recommend staying away from this app and using one of the competitors, they are better sites anyway. I hope one of the employees reaches out to me in regards to this review, but all we know that will never actually happen.

The app is really easy to use, I just wished the chat window was a bit more interactive and allowed to delete messages (lol), but again the purpose of this app is just to use it as a first step and continue chatting/texting out of it once you think you have a match. As a woman, is nice to be able to take the first step to initiate the conversation. I had 3 dates with really nice guys before finding my current boyfriend (we’ll soon be celebrating our first anniversary!), so we are both very happy we found each other with this app. The only thing I would recommend them to change is to allow choosing pictures from your phone instead of Facebook. I met one guy who had old photos on Facebook because he just didn’t interact with it a lot, so when we met in person he looked a bit different.

I was looking for something long term, and none of the other apps I tried seemed to have an option for that. With bumble, not only was this an option, but I found my perfect match. Every day I’m grateful that bumble exists for this reason. I do not have the app anymore for obvious reasons, but I recommend it highly to anyone who is looking to find a real, loving and healthy relationship. Most dating apps are set up for hookups and such. With bumble this is not the case if you don’t want it to be. I love the idea of the girl talking first too. As a girl, this does make things a little awkward, but it helps to be the one making the first move. As in other dating apps, guys typically hit girls with pickup lines or flat out ask if they want to hook up. I felt like I could explain what I was looking for so much easier with bumble. My personal trainer had recommended it to me after he found his now wife on the app. I’m so glad he told me about it. Me and my boyfriend have been together for 8 months now, and are planning on a long happy future together. \\n\\nThank you bumble, from the bottom of my heart💛',\n",

       "  'review': 'Despite official answers to the contrary, Bumble absolutely does \"shadow ban.\"  By not banning outright, this allows them to take your money and not be held accountable.  Tinder has done this for a long time, and I suspect there is not only a back-channel sharing a blacklist amongst all Match-owned sites but also industry-wide.  Reports against your profile (credible or not) are never properly investigated; anything at all will do as long as you are male, especially white, to justify adding you to a list to ensure your profile will never get shown to others.  They track everything... email, phone, billing information, wireless networks, photo hashes.  And now they use AI to retarget in case you use different photos or alter another to change the hash.  The point is, once you are on this list, even if you change phones, emails addresses, short of plastic surgery, you will continue to be shadow banned across all platforms.  Conspiracy?  Yes.  Fraudulent due to them continuing to take money with the customer expectation they will receive the same service ad everyone else?  Absolutely.  One day all of this will be exposed, but it won\\'t happen any time soon.  Save your money and find some other means to make connections.  You will not find them on this app and especially any Match-owned one.  The blacklist is real.

And I’m not saying this as a bummed out nerd who is taking their lack of female attention out on the app itself; I use just about every other dating platform and get consistent likes/matches. It makes me think that users who don’t pay suffer when it comes to views, but I’m not willing to pay the INSANE amount of money they are asking to test that theory. \\nThey could easily offer a lower tier of premium with the use of ad revenue, rather than banking that users will pay the exorbitant amount of money required to get your profile out there - and that goes for all dating apps. \\nThis no doubt causes users to lose faith in the app, or the process in general, and it’s not a sustainable business model. \\nIt’s a bummer, too, I honestly like the idea of women starting the conversation and I’m sure it’s a welcome breath of fresh air for them, not constantly being bombarded by creepy dudes all day long.

I remember premium was like $20 a month or so, then it went to $30, $35, to now $50!!! It is way too overpriced and not really that beneficial, why would I want to pay $50 just to see who likes me only for them to to not talk to me, or they’re 50 miles away when I have my preference to 20 miles!! Also they say that premium profiles get shown more but I highly doubt it because I’m usually on the app everyday swiping, and have maybe only gotten one like within the span of about every two weeks!! Premium is not worth the $50, especially since it seems like a lot of women are only using the app to promote their Instagram/Onlyfans. I don’t think this is Bumble’s fault at all, but I can’t justify spending $50 just be targeted by someone who’s not looking for a relationship, and only looking for my credit card number. I think this is my last time using Bumble. It stinks because I have been successful in the past with matches and going on dates, but it seems that this app is just getting greedy and getting ruined by opportunists. If you want to go on dates and actually find something meaningful, go on Hinge or Coffee Meets Bagel, I’ve had better luck recently on those apps.

I don’t find myself personally attracted to heavier-set women because it’s often times a visualization of the lower standards they have for themselves. Also, I think the majority of healthy men are unattracted to overweight women just like how the majority of women are unattracted to short men. I seem to live in an area where there is a fairly high proportion of overweight women and I waste so much time having to swipe through large volumes of them.\\n\\nWhat is unfair about this is that women have the ability to filter based on height. Now I’ve been blessed with being 6’3 but I understand from friends how difficult it can be to generate interest from women if they’re short. That being said, I totally understand and believe that the women on this app should be able to filter on height. The thing that I find puzzling is that height is a trait that cannot be fixed but weight is! So why can’t I filter out women who don’t put themselves through high health standards like I do? I understand that weight differs based on height, age, and muscle mass so I think having an ability to calculate BMI through the app and then being able to filter by that would be a good method.\\n\\nMen can and should have standards too!',\n",

I like that they have a lot of options on things you can add to your profile, but their monthly price is really high. $40 for basically one month, and $20 for a week, just so you can see people who have swiped on you or even to just filter things such as height preference. But what really gets me here, is the way they handle gender identity and how they categorize it. I’m a trans male, who’s interested in women, and I’ve had no problems in my past with dating women. But if I change my gender identity to “trans man” on this app and set my preference as “women” my feed is changed to nothing but other women who are interested in women, or people looking for “poly” relationships. I don’t think I’m quite what lesbians are looking for bumble? But once I set my gender back to “male” I’m brought back to women who are interested in men. So I have no choice but to just put “male” and then that I’m “trans” in my bio. So maybe something needs to be changed about that? Why should I feel that I’m less of a man on this app? I get that you try and pair “lgbtq+” with others in that same category, but make it make sense. If I say I’m “straight” I should only be seeing what my preference is. If others choose to not like me because I’m trans, let them make that decision.',\n",

There were a few accounts I saved to look at better later and hundreds I hadn’t even seen that disappeared in a flash. I wrote them on Twitter and the bumble rep was less than helpful and it got to the point where they were just rude. Later I told them I wanted the boost removed from my account completely but was told they cannot do that. \\nSince the time Boost was manually applied by them it rendered that whole match queue area useless.

       "  'review': 'I have been on Bumble since June 2019 and have experienced the tragedies and triumphs and everything in between. As with anything, if your expectation is immediate gratification you will be disappointed. If you are serious, patient, create an attractive profile and above all else, are honest you will make connections. These connections can lead to great conversations and much more. After that, it’s up to chemistry and no app has that. I have made connection and I waited for the conversation to start and the clock ran out. I have made connection and had second thoughts and let the clock run out. I have also met some amazing people and built lasting relationships. Bumble to me seems safe, exudes quality with the look of the app, the simplicity of use and the opportunity to add additional services for a price. I have done that once but really isn’t necessary. It is also very easy to update your profile as you learn what seems to be working and maybe what isn’t. With patience you will connect. Maybe not everyone you swiped right, but likely the right ones. Two tips, be HONEST...about everything including your age, and second, use the extended clock strategically, it can pay dividends. Bumble isn’t perfect but no dating app is. Happy Bumbling',\n",

       "  'review': 'So Bumble definitely shadowbans or at least outright blocks you. I had Bumble for about 2 years straight. One of the women I met off there ended up stalking me and I deleted the account out of fear she would create fake profiles and try to monitor me. Needless to say I ended up moving for work and decided to make another account now that I felt safe. Within the first hour I had several likes, however, that stopped instantly after that. Nothing after that first hour (I live in a large metropolitan area so this is unusual). I’m also not an ugly guy by any means. It’s not difficult to see who likes your profile since bumble’s blurred image for your queue is easily distinguishable when swiping. I noticed that one particular like I had showed up in my stack and I didn’t swipe on it initially. I reopened the app later to see my likes disappear. HOWEVER, these profiles still showed up in the stack and they are unable to unlike your profile once they’ve swiped right. This happened with almost all of the likes I had and they weren’t bot profiles. I received no more likes since that first hour and I kept the app for a week and a half to make sure. Pretty pathetic I received whatever “ban” they clearly have in place simply because I deleted my account to protect myself. Not like I’m deleting and recreating the app every other week. Won’t be recommending or using (like I could anyway) this app again.',\n",

I shouldn’t have to pay money just to meet someone. I get that bumble is being the middle man in the possible relationship but that’s what gets me. It’s a “possible” relationship. I don’t know if it’ll work out or not why should I pay 40 dollars just to see someone’s profile that may or may not be close to me at all! It’s a joke and a scam. If you wanted to help people meet other people why make them pay for it? Why couldn’t you just put ads in from sponsors like you do for push notifications? That gives you money doesn’t it? Or an actual 10 second ad after so many skips then give the option for a one time purchase to stop the ads. I don’t see why I need to pay what was it 20-40 dollars for a week!?! Absolutely ridiculous what a waste of time.\\nIf you read to this point believe me it’s just like every other dating app asking for money to see someone. It’s disappointing.

It seems like most people on here are genuine, although I do wish there was just a bit more diversity. I love the time limit concept on the matches, it’s quite ingenious. It creates a sense of urgency which is great but also has its cons. The app itself is smooth and very user friendly, plus the no limits on swiping is just the icing on the cake. If you don’t have a paid subscription however, which allows you to see everyone that swiped right on you (amongst other great perks I’m sure), it can be easy to waste a lot of time on the app just swiping.

We met up to hang out then insisted I go back to her place. I was hesitant to do it but I wasn’t expecting anything bad to happen. After a few drinks we were sitting on the couch and she started touching me. I wasn’t comfortable with the way this was happening so I told her to stop. Needless to say she didn’t. She just kept touching me. I must’ve offended her because she insulted me and said I must not like girls if I didn’t consent, then proceeded to grab me. I’m a large man so I was able to get her away and left. I went to report her in the app but it seems she had gotten to me first. I couldn’t even go to the police if I wanted to because I had no way of getting her name or info because bumble banned my profile and any new ones I try to create. I’ve sent countless emails to them hoping to get unbanned or at least the information from the girl. I even attached as much evidence as I could to support my claims, but haven’t hear a single word. All I want is to make sure this doesn’t happen to other men or people in general. Seems like the team at bumble isn’t very worried about the safety of their users.

Additionally, I think the fundamental aspect of having the woman strike up conversation first is a HUGE bonus, when you consider how unlikely it is for them to do so on other apps. \\n\\nHOWEVER, the company is going in a greedy direction, starting with two significant features: the amount of swipes and the reverse button (if you accidentally swiped left). In the last 6 months or so Bumble has significantly reduced your amount of swipes, which is of course a far more important issue for your average man than woman. Most of these other apps that I’ve used employ this feature of limited swipes, but Bumble used to give you so many more swipes (it might’ve been unlimited) nowadays I‘ll\\n swipe on like 25 people before running out and having to wait a day? My matches have significantly dropped and it’s almost pointless to have this app because it’s just like all the other ones now. The aforementioned features are what made it different (and better!), but it seems like they want you to pay for them now, which is understandable (paying more for more services) but how does it differentiate from the myriad of other apps that have saturated the market? I don’t know. Personally, it’s not enough of an incentive to keep this spacious app on my phone.',\n",

Not me, because it feels like I’m shopping for a person and putting myself on a market (which is really what dating apps are for, obviously). \\n\\nHowever, with the free version, you can send messages to matches (they have 24 hours to respond) and you have unlimited messages once you match. In addition, Bumble adapts. I actually like that they changed it to only allowing you to view/like a few people at a time — it helps keep you logging in, so you maybe won’t miss messages with/from matches. A downside to this change, though, is that I always have, like, 50 likes (most of them I won’t like back because we’re clearly incompatible in some way), and it’s going to take longer to make matches with those likes. But, anything good takes time… so, I guess that makes sense. \\n\\nBumble is doing alright — with BFF (helpful when you’ve moved to a new state!) and with Date.

Also the women I’ve matched with all seem exactly the same. Idk if it’s just coincidental but they are all are boring and answer like days later. It’s somewhat confusing, considering they matched me and liked my photos. Last but not least, I’ve encountered women who for some reason delete their accounts.... only to make another one with a different name and different pictures? I can tell it’s the same women because “Duh it’s obvious” but it’s creepy and makes me wonder who tf I’m talking to. This app is good because it’s more freedom unlike tinder, I actually feel like I can talk to ppl on here. But it suffers from the same thing tinder does. It’s just the gratification u can possibly talk to these women. It’s not guaranteed or anything. Again this app isn’t bad, surly better set up then tinder but, just awkward and boring at times.

       "  'review': 'I started using this app right around 2016 and had a decent amount of luck on it. I think back then there was a limit of 100 swipes per day or more. What I understand is that while the free version needs to limit the swipes to monetize, the experience as a straight male suffers as a result. \\n\\nIt’s not that I think the limit on males is really a problem, but it’s the limit for women that makes the experience worse. Let’s say I pay for premium (I once considered lifetime which I’m not sure is an option anymore?). Sure, I’d get unlimited swipes, but any women using the free version still get 25/day, so this will make the smaller population pickier which just hurts everyone. \\n\\nIdk for sure, but I’m willing to bet the population that pays most are straight men. Maybe consider increasing the free limit for just women to 50+/day? The way I see it, it would create a ripple, men have more potential matches, more incentive to subscribe, and women feel less concerned to only pick 25 per day. From my perspective, I’m never going to subscribe if 2/350 match when it used to be 5/100 or so. Why would I pay to swipe through 100 people a day if it means less than 1 per day match and 1/500 start the conversation?',\n",

       "  'review': 'Through my 2 year experience with the app, I’d like to give me truthfully and honest opinion about the app. First off I give it a 3 star because this app doesn’t care about weather or not you find someone. At one point it did but now it’s turned into a “pay to play” app, which is unfortunate considering how much bumble pushes and promotes finding “the one” through them. Number 2 bumble has a simple algorithm: we give you a limited amount of swipes, we’ll have 2 “mock” profiles shoot you likes but you won’t get to see them nor be able to like them back. Oh no you ran out of swipes? Well simple pay us for premium and you’ll get all the benefits except the two profiles that liked you won’t text you within the 24 hour period we give them to text you. Now for the rest of the time you have premium you’ll have all the benefits but won’t reap the reward of finding someone. Very simple algorithm to understand and it amazes me how the app will consistently continue to make you believe that you’ll eventually find a match. So inclusion if you are going to spend money on a dating app, go to Tinder; because at least there, they won’t  sell you a bunch of lies to keep you on there.',\n",

If you’re a girl who has bought into the victim oppressor narrative but is fine with controlling and dominating men, then this app is for you, actually all dating apps were made fore you. Except for one thing, the best men left apps a long time ago and are looking for relationships elsewhere. Not because they want to go back to a time when men dominated women, but just because they want to be in equal footing, and feel free to embrace the positive side of their masculinity. Like being bold, decisive, courageous, protective. How can you do this when apps like Bumble force you into a submissive posture and give women too much power to kick men off the platforms for acting “inappropriately” as defined, or not, by women. Are women happier with this new found power? Not in my experience. Statistically, they are opting for other women, or dogs, or seeking out therapists to figure out why they can’t achieve satisfaction in their relationships. And apps like Bumble are part of the problem. But the good news is that this is mostly a US phenomena. So update those passports boys, because it gets much better as soon as you cross the border in any direction except North 🇨🇦 hahaha.

Avoid this app. They ban people for no reason, or likely based on the lies of people you reject. Don’t waste your money. I tried emailing them several times for an explanation and got nothing. Terrible customer service. Their terms of service say that you are not entitled to a refund if you break their rules.

Anyone can literally submit a report accusing someone of bad offline behavior. Bumble makes no effort to verify or follow up, they just ban.

With Bumble’s “consequence feature” you lose a match if you do not reach out in time.  This ensures serious inquiries and leaves those looking for hookups to the likes of Tinder.  With all that being said, I found my Bumble account inaccessible one day due to a political blanket statement regarding certain current events this year (2020).  I scoured the pop up looking for the elusive “X” in a corner to get out of it.  However, my only option was to click “Accept.”  I have no clue what I was accepting.  It seems Bumble was forcing users to accept their platform’s political interpretation and narrative.  I fundamentally disagree with this.  Bumble is an app designed ultimately for dating, and not a political organization taking a stand.  Which stifles diversity on the app.  At this point, perhaps Bumble should even consider removing political orientation from the “about you” section.   After being forced to click accept or never access my profile again.  I hastily and happily deleted my profile.  Prior to this I would have generally considered Bumble as one of the better dating apps available.  However, unless you accept and agree to their political narrative, you’ll find yourself unable to use the app for what it was designed for, dating.',\n",

It would be very helpful to have a “Who I’m looking for” feature on the guys’ profile. That way black women like myself are not having to guess on whether a guy would like me or not because of the color of my skin. (I found myself trying to see if a guy had black friends based upon his profile pictures or if he listened to black artists just to make a guess on whether he would even like me). My experience on Bumble made me feel undesirable & like I wasn’t even meant to be on here in the first place. And if that’s truly the case, I think it should be clarified in the App Store that this app is only for white people (I don’t mean to be cynical.

It’s about business as usual, trying to keep you on the app for as long as possible while not getting you a match. I get that this is the model that all dating apps function on but at least try to make it less obvious. People who are motivated to find someone don’t need a reminder to go on a dating app. They just need to know when they get a match or a like. That’s it. \\nConcerning the swiping mechanism, I can’t tell you how often I’ve swiped right or left by accident while trying to scroll down on a profile.

I recently decided to give it another go, but in order to actually see any of the people who like you you have to pay a $21 subscription fee. What’s the point? Look, I’m completely understanding that companies are looking to make money off of apps, but most of them allow you to use basic features for free, or at the very last show ads. That’s not even the case at all here. They let you waste time building a profile, adding pictures, seeing if there’s anyone you want to match with, then God forbid anyone likes you back and you want to see them, you have to subscribe. Also $21 is steep. Most streaming services don’t cost half of that price and it just seems insane to me. I will uninstall and never use again when there’s plenty of other working options for this type of thing out there that let you use their service without requiring paying monthly. Also, it’s $21 a WEEK, $45 a month.\\n\\nAlso can you cut the crap with the adding pronouns section? If somebody cares so much about letting you know, they can easily put it in their bio. Thanks for the heads up. God forbid I found a solid match and they didn’t have the pronouns I was interested in, I’d have to swipe left.',\n",

A friend of mine recommended I try Bumble and after a couple days I was at work scrolling through and I come across this beautiful lady. Very sincere in every word, felt like I got a strong understanding of who she was on the profile descriptions she had. I swipe right on her and think “no way she matches with me but hey worth a shot” next thing I know it was an instant match! I was excited but not getting my hopes up, it’s internet dating this doesn’t go very far most of the time. \\n\\nShe texts me a couple a hours later and we start talking about music, both of our lives and what we do for work, shortly later we FaceTime and we talk consistently for a month before finally meeting in person. We started dating in October, 2019, got engaged October of 2021 and just got married in September of 2023!

I’m getting guys in my queue who are 100+ miles away. I live in Oklahoma and I have guys still in my queue from FLORIDA that I assume are there from my vacation back in JUNE. I also have guys from Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, and have gotten several from Texas and Colorado. This feature is AWFUL. If other people want to set their search radius for super far away, fine. But if mine is set to 50 miles, I don’t want to see ANYONE outside that radius! Even if I was in the same town as they were for a short period of time, and even if they swiped on me. If I had wanted to see who was available while I was in Florida, I would have opened the app to look.

Happened to get off all dating app platforms shortly afterwards until just recently, and trying to get my purchase restored to my new account has been a nightmare.\\n\\nFirst off, I’m fairly certain Bumble is the sole app that lacks an in-app purchase restoration option, which feels pretty shady.  As far as I can tell, they also lack a customer service chat AND phone number, leaving e-mail as the only available method.  Initially, I was told they couldn’t find my purchase receipt.  Then, after explaining that I was not the primary account holder in my Family Plan and perhaps it was tied to that email — though it shouldn’t be, as it was made my from previous Bumble account tied to my Apple ID — they stated they had in fact already found it, but they would instead need the payment confirmation from my email.  Ended up providing it in a response, then tried following up and even sent a whole new inquiry, and still have yet to hear anything from them after several hours.\\n\\nI have to ask, is this an intentional run-around to withhold services despite payment?  Perhaps even aiming at further purchases made out of exasperation?',\n",

Giving women control over the conversation is a game changer and the pre made conversation starters are to die for and I love how you can set height preferences and get two free filters, but the cons are pretty hefty for me. One major update they need is gender identity. To be the best app and stay up there it would be great if people knew you are open to everyone. Having a gender identity option would be great for existing users so there is no more confusion. Also a lot of people complain about not getting notifications from the app and I can agree to that. Unless I see a badge icon or check the app I will not know if a guy messaged me and that takes away from the 24 hr window making a lot of us miss out on opportunities because no notification for messages come in but matches do. Some refining on the “looking for “ option would be great. It’s very difficult talking to someone when you want a relationship and they just want a hookup because the profiles don’t give that good of clarification. \\n\\nAll in all bumble is a good app with amazing features and a growing community but within that community does come transgender people, non binary ppl, etc. There should be an option for them.',\n",

It’s outrageously priced at $40 a month. They’re insane charging this for multiple reasons. 85% of the likes you’ll receive are fake profiles that say “add my snap” and the 15% that do match you that are real don’t message you since the ladies have to message first. I’ve even utilized their boost multiple times during peak hours and got barely any likes. Which by the way boosts cost money and you only get one free one a week with premium then they’re about $7 each after that. So you end up buying the bundle deals. This app is a cash grab trust me don’t ever pay for it. Honestly don’t even use it. The free version is terrible. There’s so many other free dating app options that let you send 50 likes a day and their paid versions actually get you matches.

However, I do have my opinions about the app. Things that could be added and taken away. One being, making it possible to upload short videos to one’s profile. Second being, adding more space for more pictures. Six just isn’t enough. Finally, the third thing I’ll mention is, taking away the whole timer thing. Why do I only have a limited amount of time to start a conversation with someone? Or a limited amount of time to reply back? You do know people are busy with their life right? No-one is looking at their phone 24/7. And  a lot of us don’t care to have the notifications on. You guys are really showing how greedy you are. This is why I like Hinge better.

This is disappointing considering I paid for the lifetime subscription. Be wary of spending money with Bumble because if something goes wrong, they are not there to help.\\n\\nEDIT: at two months of reaching out to support, I still cannot get to a person that can help. I have emailed back and forth with support for months… When I purchased the lifetime bumble in 2019, it included travel mode and advanced filters.  For the past 4 years, I have been able to use those with the subscription that I purchased. Recently, Bumble changed their purchasing model to have 2 options: bumble boost and a premium option.  Bumble has taken away the advanced filters and travel  from lifetime Bumble subscribers that purchased years ago and is expecting them to pay AGAIN all because they rebranded their purchasing options.  This is ridiculous and unfair.  On top of that, their support is unresponsive and unhelpful.  The old support could help super quickly—now 90% of the responses I am getting from support are canned or from bots.  I wish I could speak to a person who could help.

After a couple of text exchanges, I discovered that he lived in a mist undesirable part of town. Without malice, I simply stated that I don’t go to that part of town. Horace then proceeded to block and report me for “abusive language “; after which I received an email admonishment from the Bumble administrator. When I explained the situation I was notified that it had happened before. The issue that I have with this is that petty, insecure and immature men who lack the ability to accept rejection have the ability on this app to shut down your account. The administrators view the false complaint(s) and not your actual texts. I explained to the administrator that if they viewed my texts prior to sending an unwarranted warning they would have seen that I have never said anything untoward, unkind or malicious to anyone on the app. We, as females, have the right to reflect potential suitors for ANY reason and should not be penalized by the app for exercising this right. False allegations should be thoroughly vetted before sending out unfounded warnings.

Also they have 24 hours to message you and you have 24 hours back which is nonsense. For full access it costs about $22 a month and Tinder costs $8 a month. I can swipe until my phone dies on tinder but it might take 5 minutes on Bumble ie low amount of users. You can run out of likes on free Tinder but on free Bumble it’ll close you out on just swipes alone for 24 hours. The filter options are nice where you can pick height, exercise, drinking, smoking etc but the high quality selection on here will run out quick (standards vary). I see this as a break from the toxicity of tinder where 2/3 are sex scammers or game players but it feels the same after a couple days. I have had a fair amount of success on tinder (hookups, dates, and relationships) but do yourself a favor and don’t go on any dating apps.

I also dislike that they got rid of the 3 free rewinds & the free rematching, because I looked at my past matches that have run out and was looking to connect with one of them - but I noticed that you can’t rematch for free anymore! It’s so obvious that none of the people using this app want a real relationship - like someone else said, your matches are too busy messaging the 100s of other girls that matched with them. Far too many of the men on here are just bored and need to relieve some boredom, but they should probably find a different hobby. I also recently noticed that I have no more possible people in my area to swipe on, which seems really odd because I don’t swipe right too often.

This meant that it just kept suggesting me regular men who were typically straight.

I have emailed Bumble about it because I was confused as to why no women were showing up, and they basically said they had no intention of changing it. Assuming that males can only be friends with other males and females can only be friends with other females is incredible heteronormative and sexist. I liked everything else about the app, but couldn’t even use it because I had no friends to match with.

Your premium account price is akin to a Gold’s Gym membership or a nice meal I could’ve spent on a date. 26 dollars a month isn’t breaking banks but it’s stupid considering what you’re giving. All these dating apps must be smoking meth, it is sad to see you set that steep a price and gatekeep what essentially is a gamble on a half built platform. My recommendation would be to try Hinge, I have spoken to and had nice dates with a few women and it didn’t cost me my kidney to arrange it.

But in practice, I’ve had far more luck making genuine connections on other apps. It seems like men swipe right on everyone but then decide if they’re actually going to respond if you reach out. The response rate even though we’ve matched is really low and the conversations even when I’ve tried to drive them are lackluster. I’m still seeing just as many profiles that indicate they want a hookup or nothing serious. Not something the app is responsible for, just an observation that the promise of putting women in control doesn’t seem to solve some of the problems of lazy men. \\nThe 24 hour time limit is also, while well-intentioned, frustrating without a hold button. I like to go backpacking, which is an activity that takes me off the grid. But if I match during that time I either have to pay for a redo or let a match go by. It doesn’t seem to value busy people. A feature that would let you put your profile into “away” mode seems like it could be really useful in helping to let busy, interesting people meet one another without looking disinterested.',\n",

Yet, we’re supposed to be tied to our phone waiting for that match to come in and then message within 24 hours. I feel this goes against what Bumble preaches. Sometimes I’m a busy bee taking on the world at work and don’t have time to message someone within 24hours and the same for bumble guys. I think, not sitting on a match forever is right on, but I suggest a “3-day rule” for initial responses. Give people time to have balance with dating and other life responsibilities. Also, why can men extend a match for 24h but women cannot? The app says if a match expires you can have a chance to match again but why would I swipe again on a person that either ignored me or ran out of time the first time?

There is an ability to display your political affiliation with the options; conservative, liberal, moderate, or apolitical. This liberal option should be changed, as it is not an inverse of conservative. Liberal means favoring freedom and liberty (also having respect for and being open to others’ opinions, whether political or not), while conservative means liking the laws and government to be conserved, or stay the same. The inverse of conservative would be progressive, meaning wanting changes to laws and government. This is not how a scale works, and if it’s not a scale it doesn’t make sense to have moderate as an option. Liberal should be changed to progressive, or just change both to say Republican and Democrat which I think would be more effective because conservative and progressive are not specific on the areas people would like to conserve or progress in, while the political parties would be more specific on what somebody’s views are.

Now I have to wait a full 24 hours just to get what another 10 swipes. Why doesn’t it reset each day regardless of how many swipes you did the day before? Dating app has become a gatcha mobile game where you have to log on everyday to receive your daily reward. That’s not how dating should work, and that’s not how apps promoting dating should work.',\n",

       "  'review': 'So this app is not what it used to be. I got this app when it first came out since I was hearing it was a platform more serious then Tinder at the time. I used it for awhile and I had some decent luck. I took some time off due to meeting someone in person and after 5 years I eventually made my way back. Since I’ve been back it’s been a horrible experience. I constantly get a lot of likes but they just sit in the Q until they expire with no way of engaging the person. I honestly think it’s for\\nInsecure women to feel good about themselves without the commitment😂 I’ve had a couple conversations (With no indication of it going badly) leave off on a planned date for the night and by the next morning they are gone from the platform. The few dates that have gone thru had me running all over the place paying getting the tab just to tell me the next day their not looking for anything, they don’t want anything to do with me, or I’m not the one. So after much self-reflection and being a pretty self-aware human I can honestly say I was a gentleman and did nothing out of context. Which brings me to the conclusion that this app is filled with insecure, scammy, and users. I would personally recommend Hinge or even Tinder is better then the experience I had on this one.',\n",

       "  'review': 'So I will start with this statement bumble is basically an app for  misandrists. I strongly believe it is a feminist based concept to empower women in the wrong way. It’s a cool concept at first but if you step back and look at is in reverse it would be hell to pay if women where not allowed to speak first. People are creepy not just men. I came across several women that where psychotic and severely delusional about reality of relationships. It’s not very diverse it’s for white men whom are 28-40 making 6 figures a year. That’s what it’s seems to be the status quo “status”. If you do match with a female to beat the 24 hr timer they say “hello” and nothing else. So then you stay in que indefinitely. You never here back from them. My account was moderated for no reason. I don’t use bad language I’m respectful. They could not tell me what I said to violate policy. It’s total garbage app I’ve been on it a year now to give it a fair chance. Well chances are you won’t get far on Bumble unless you are a beta male. This is so sad society has come to this.  I’m going back to the old fashioned way of meeting. Bumble needs a lot of changes to make it male friendlier. Who wants to sit and wait for days till someone response to you. Then the women complain about being ghosted and being lied to. Well the women on the app do the same thing. ✌🏽',\n",

Something about ‘several complaints’ of me selling something!?!? That’s absolutely not true and if someone has (falsely) reported me for such things, it’s just some lowlife scammer upset that I’m not responsive to his sob story about being ‘stationed in Afghanistan on a peacekeeping mission while widowed and left with 2 young gorgeous children and a German Shepherd, just looking for a Mum to love them’.

On dating you can choose to see men or women, but that’s it. I think that’s pretty unfair and non inclusive. If a guy goes on bumble bff and tries to come onto women, allow us to report that ONE guy and maybe implement some sorta “three strikes and you’re banned” rule or sumn idk, but to just completely cut off our ability to even attempt to befriend the opposite sex is kinda backwards. \\n\\nAlso, the gender incision is great when it comes to what you can put in your bio, but that’s where it stops. If I put that I’m non-binary, I still have to choose to show my profile to people looking for men or women…….Make it make sense….\\nI think filters should be opened up way more, ESPECIALLY on the bff side. Sometimes I specifically want to find more non-binary friends, or trans male friends etc. it’s a good concept but I’d like to see a lot of changes too before I could really use it for what I want right now…',\n",

The swipe is too sensitive on this app, which is really frustrating considering you limit the amount of likes we can send. I’ve accidentally swiped “right” on several users when I’m simply trying to scroll down to read their profile. It’s really annoying considering I run out of likes when I finally find someone I’m interested in. I also recommend that you don’t delete people that have “liked” me when I swipe left on them. It took me a while to figure out that was happening, and I thought people were unliking me because I had flaws on my profile. I just feel like this app is not very intuitive, and doesn’t make a lot of sense. And if only women can message first, don’t limit how many people we can swipe right on.\\n\\nEdit: I see your response, and it’s not addressing the actual issue; what y’all consider a “swipe” is still too sensitive and it wastes my limited swipes.

Yes, it puts the onus on the girl to take a leap and make the first move. But, many articles have shown that most people who use a dating app, don’t check it regularly and/or have the notifications turned off for the app. So, if you match with a person and take a little while to finally get the courage to send them something, the person may not even be on there within the 24 hrs that you send them the message and your conversation just dies before you even have a chance! Back to square one. And who knows, that person could’ve been a good match. If you’re going to put a time limit on it, make it something like 72 hrs. If someone doesn’t answer in 72 hrs, then  they’re just not interested. I don’t know, it feels like the opposite of “,empowering women,” to constantly be disappointed and discouraged by having a match go cold before it even has a chance to develop…',\n",

If I didn’t check it more often I could easily miss some connections and I know some people have missed the match with me because they never got a notification about it. In addition there are too many flaky people on the app which makes it almost worthless. There should be some kind of algorithm on the app that punishes those who are here just to collect matches and who don’t communicate once matched. But then again, some of that could be due to a poor notification system. Bumble, why don’t you just use advertising to pay most of the bills? It’s the perfect platform for it and might actually benefit everybody. Maybe continue with memberships for the people who really want the fancy stuff, but you don’t have to take away everything from the user base. Otherwise it’s just another Tinder.

And if you do, which you would think was flattering that someone wants to get to know them, they act like you’re some crazy person bothering them.  I think men see this as revenge for all the other sites where they get ignored by women, because I’ve seen several profiles that say, “Come up with something better than ‘Hi’ or ‘How are you?’” or “Must be over a 7” or “$100 to any woman who can write a profile without saying ‘travel’, ‘wanderlust’ or ‘no hookups’”.  I have been using it for months and have not come across any men who actually want to meet someone, I think they just use it as a swiping game to see how many matches they can get, but if you actually try to contact them, they ignore you.

It went on for two days until they finally came out and told me they’re not actually the person in their profile, that they were just trolling me, and calling me gullible for believing them. I cussed them out in literally 6 words and reported them. It was so depressing and I felt like an idiot. Then get this… Bumble bans ME?! I reached out to customer support and they said they “investigated” it but they’re still going to permanently ban me because the company is “rooted in kindness, respect…” If they actually read through our entire conversation history and did their job right, they would know how royally they messed up and have it completely backwards. I am just appalled by the whole thing. I also paid for the premium membership which I’m sure they’re not going to refund me for, so add getting robbed to the list.',\n",

It helps me work up the courage to approach the guy for a change. More than half the time they don’t answer, but I can’t do anything about that. That being said, I’d like to comment on some new features I noticed and give some feedback. I love that you can add like quirks about yourself ie. perfect first date, two truths and a lie, etc. I also love that you can now see what people are looking for, religious preferences, if they want children and the like. What I think would be cool to see is if you could filter people based off these features. I’m currently looking for someone who wants a relationship, but has no interest in having kids in the future and I find that it’s a pain to have to sort through all the people who aren’t looking for the same. It makes the dating process even more of a pain. Just a thought. Everything else about the app is great and hopefully I’ll eventually find someone on it!',\n",

They do not care about your immediate pain points or the usability of the app. I been stuck on the wrong location and they could have offer you change the location or even provide free coins for me to change the travel location, unfortunately they did neither. The developers are greedy and does not values its users and does not value user experience and providing great customer support. My user experience on coffee meets bagel and paid experience there is so much better. The paid service on bumble offers little value and no competitive advantage. The developers does not know what basic features to include and what paid features to implement. Terrible product management team with bad product strategy .',\n",

Bumble usually does a pretty good job of letting you know when you’re liked, but recently I noticed they have been giving accounts that “like you” but no matter how much you swipe.. you’ll never see them. At first I was confused after hitting the “no more people around you” message and bumble was still saying someone liked you. Then I realized almost every third card or swipe I got was an ad promoting their premium service and the ability to “see who likes you”. That’s when I realized they’re just putting either a fake picture in the “people who like you” box, or their burying an actual person who does like you in order for your curiosity or frustration to push you into buying their premium. I get it bumble, a premium service is a good idea for some. But this somehow feels underhanded or sneaky to me and I’m not a fan. Definitely still going to use the app lol but not as enthusiastically as before',\n",

The goal is to get you to pay and to keep you paying.

They allow people to make accounts over and over again. I learned this after repeatedly blocking someone. When I brought this to their attention they initially began to remove the profile, but after the person continued to recreate the same profile at least a dozen times they stopped removing the profile and instead responded with something like “if someone else reports the profile we’ll remove it.” At that point I decided to delete my account. It’s against the terms and conditions to repeatedly make accounts, and for an app that prides itself in making women feel safe blocking ip addresses of people who do this so frequently in such a short period of time would make women think they take safety seriously.',\n",

So matching with someone who might not be on the app during the time limit definitely kills this app. That person might not come on to bumble for another week but they give 24 hours to make a decision. That feature in my opinion is  killing the app the Dramatically. You matched with someone but come to find out you were late cause you didn’t engage with the app when the app wants you too. I do not  like that it  forces  you to make a move right now. Obviously this is what set bumble and tinder apart is women making the first move. And I can honestly say I met fewer women on this app then tinder due to this feature. I’m all for the empowerment of women but this ain’t it. These two things make the app very inconsistent from my experience. You match with few girls in a week. But they never say anything due to time limit and having to make the first move .',\n",

There’s no way to undo it when you swipe right either. It would be nice if they had an option to turn off the swiping feature so people who didn’t want to swipe could still send matches by using the buttons on the bottom of the profiles. In addition, Bumble only gives you a few profiles to look at a time. Once you’ve looked through about 4 profiles, you’ll need to wait before looking through more. I don’t know why I can’t look through as many as I want at a time especially when I’m paying for the subscription. Finally, I believe you can only send 1 compliment per day to someone.

       "  'review': 'I’ve used all of the dating sites/apps over the past 6 months and as a man can tell you it is rare for any attractive woman to like you first.  When I joined bumble however with a paid week to see who likes me I received 43 likes from beautiful woman in the first 12 hours, sorry guys that just doesn’t happen.  For fun I went ahead and matched with all of them and guess what happened?  24 hours later they were all gone because none of these beautiful women ever started a conversation.  It’s now a week later and not one single other person has liked my profile.  No question about it this app gives you an absurd amount of fake likes the first day to get you to pay and then you realize they are all fake.  Do not waste your time guys\\n\\nUpdate August 2020.  They changed the app recently and instead of showing you people who have liked you first bumble now does not show them to you at all.  I scrolled through all profiles in my area and it still had not shown me a single person who liked me t he number of likes never decreased. I even had a female friend nearby like me and it never showed her to me.  You cannot March with likes unless you pay for the app thus making it even more useless',\n",

       "  'review': 'I’ve used Bumble on and off since it started years ago, and was excited when they finally added more filters. Now that they put all the useful filters behind a paywall, the app is just like Tinder. I was using the education and relationship type filters to find men with graduate degrees who wanted at least a relationship if not marriage, and found a really decent guy (who ended up getting deployed unfortunately). Now I can’t find anyone compatible without the filters. Furthermore, you now end up forced to sift through profiles that are far outside what you’re looking for, which tires you out. I want to delete this app, but I feel like it’s the only good option compared to the others. Though I’ll never ever pay for the filters or extra filters. I used to love Hinge but I got banned for no reason and created a new profile that never gets any likes or matches. This entire industry of online dating is hopeless and life sucking. Everyone should keep in mind these apps are designed to keep you on there indefinitely - they don’t have any interest in helping you find a spouse and deleting the app bc then they’d lose money. Don’t ever pay for any of the extra features.',\n",

       "  'review': 'It LACKS ONE great feature. Please for the love of God. It needs to have a “similar interest” feature. They have filters that’s cool, far as relationship wise. But I think it would be amazing if you can filter between people who have your same “my interest.” So if the both of you are into design, or photography, or both into wine, or cooking, the gym or exploring new cities etc. I feel like if this feature was added it’ll be a better way for people to spark more INTERESTING conversations. Rather than just matching with someone for how they look, & relationship, & religious preference it can create a more in debt conversation because you have similar interest. I’ve run across a few people with the same interest as me & we’ve had some good convos. But it rarely happens so I rarely have matches. Please make this a feature. UGH. Nothing is better to me than running across a girl that’s into art. But I have to weed through 30 girls to meet with one girl who’s into the same things as me. Smh',\n",

Recently my account was deleted after I went back on app, and I was very surprised knowing that I did not do anything wrong (or perhaps someone might have had reported me? - still surprised me to ask myself “what just happened?”). I was agonized about the situation because I had great matches and connections. So later, I made a new account, which had a verified profile, verified phone number and email, with a paid subscription to add further, that it seems Bumble took down my latest account without acknowledgment or reason, again. I reached out to the support team (by several emails sent weekly) and no response. I had to contact Apple to get back all the subscribed refunds since my accounts were blocked or removed from the app. Till this day, I am unsure why Bumble would do such a thing.\\nPersonally, Bumble is careless about loyal customers and brand loyalty. It’s not fair, especially for me and anyone who deal with this matter, because we want to find connections and dates.

       "  'review': 'I really enjoyed using Bumble for the first year, which is why I’ll still give 2 stars. I got about 5-10 likes per week—more if I used a Spotlight. Last month, I started using a VPN to keep myself secure, and all of a sudden I stopped getting likes at all except for when I use a Spotlight (I’ll still get about 10 likes in 2.5 hours). I’m not saying I’m the most desirable person ever, but to go from 5-10 likes/week to zero is pretty weird. I did some research and found a lot of people who stopped getting likes after they started using VPNs. The theory is that Bumble’s algorithm marks VPN users as spammers and keeps them out of others’ feeds. Now my Bumble experience is totally screwed because I chose to protect my privacy online.\\n\\nUpdate: I sent Bumble Support a message about this. They responded saying nothing was going on, but also I immediately went back to getting 5-10 likes per week 🤷. I’ll still give them four stars.

       "  'review': 'It’s just another dating app tbh except the creators of this one are really proud of it. I can’t see how they justify $50/month for a subscription. You can use it for free, but you can’t see who liked you and there’s limitations to other features. \\n\\nThe user interface is smooth, easy to use, and looks good, which is nice. There is also some cool features like speed dating, which I haven’t seen other apps do, but tbh the biggest negative for me is the cost of a subscription. I have the tendency to buy the subscriptions for some apps for like a month at a time once in a while, so I can play with the premium features, but the price is just too much here. It’s got me double checking sometimes to see if it’s still that expensive, like maybe I misread it. You’ve got to offer something that stands out from the competition in order to justify a price like that. Not when Hinge or even FB dating has most of the same features like undoing a dislike and seeing who liked you for no cost. \\n\\nJust my thoughts though.

My biggest request though is that I think it would be really useful to have the option to opt out of the “women have to send the first message” thing. I get it, it’s a great idea, but sometimes I get so busy or I just can’t think of anything interesting enough to say (I don’t want to use a generic “hey”) and my match disappears! I end up feeling like I potentially missed out on a really great guy or wondering if they had anything interesting they would have said to me first.

I would get out and grow so confidence and try to meet people in the real world because I believe this subconscious on demand shopping for dAtes has really destroyed the male And female psyche of attraction.

Women are the ones in charge of starting conversations, which more often than not feels like a burden rather than a right. It’s 2019–actual feminists recognize that men do not need to be doing all of the initiating! Most women are not scared to start a conversation, especially if they’ve matched with someone on their dating app; we don’t need to be thrust into conversation-starting like that, it feels paternalistic, tbh. And the conversation prompts are stupid, like the “I feel most empowered when...” ?? It’s weird to see female empowerment commodified in this way. It cheapens it. Obviously, this isn’t all bumbles fault: they were trying to solve an epidemic of harassment through dating apps, but the root of the problem is societal gender differences, not the functions of the app itself. Other than that, Bumble is a good app. Gets the job done. I would love if we could delete conversation prompts from our bio if we don’t want them anymore!!!!',\n",

I like how the profiles go into more detail, allowing you to know more about users before making your choice, but my favorite thing about the app was the option to filter so that you only saw users with qualities and traits that you are looking for. Being able to filter for height allowed me to narrow the amount of people I saw down to a manageable number. Filtering for what users are looking for prevented me from wasting time swiping through people with different intentions than me. Required profile questions allowed me to learn more about users before I made a decision, which was a big reason that I found bumble the most appealing dating app. Without these features bumble is no better than any of the other apps out there and I might as well switch to other apps that don’t require women to speak first and let matches expire before a busy person has a chance to reach out if I’m going to have to swipe through every man in the entire city anyway.',\n",

Long story short I found out he was a catfish even though he had a blue check mark next to his name meaning he is verified. I thought it was cool that you can verify yourself on this app to try and prevent being catfished but it really didn’t make a difference. The main thing I also don’t like is how my location is public. I understand they need my location in order to find local people for me to match with but why does it have to show on my profile for everyone to see? Prior to me finding out that the guy I was taking to was a catfish I noticed one day that he was about 10 miles away from my location even though he lived 60 miles away from me. I don’t know if this was a coincidence but it was concerning to me. I ended up blocking and reporting him after he finally admitted that he was a catfish and I’m not sure if bumble did anything or not.

And I got to meet up with a gal at Wendy’s, see some of her friends, took a hike in our area, and played some uno while we were watching a romcom! Spent 3 days in a row together!!! This app has been really helpful in my two weeks of moving to a new area! Just started utilizing the Bizz option... then just started the Dating to try it out! I’ve been super skeptical over dating apps! But I love how easy it is to express yourself through the app and I feel decently comfortable to try dating again because of this! So I’m curious what will come out of that! \\nYou don’t have to pay for anything unless you want to find who is swiping right on you. I’d also recommend using the app in a part of town you love! You’ll find better matches! 💜',\n",

After a few months I find out she is MARRIED and I break things off with her, naturally. This woman has then proceeded to try and smear my name at every turn. She writes a complaint about me to Bumble who has since shut my account down with no chance of a review. Their customer service just sends me a generic message that all decisions are final. Is there a chance of my profile being restored? How about reimbursements for my paid subscription(s)? Yeah right. This all feels very unfair to me. I’ve not had any issues in years on this application and one complaint made by a motivated individual has me completely blacklisted? I just don’t understand how the facts point in such a way where I have violated any of Bumbles terms or conditions? I’ve been a model paying user with high engagement and someone who misrepresented themselves through their profile has the ability to get me unilaterally blocked. I am having a hard time wrapping my head around this. All the time and money invested into my profile and they could care less. Just wow.',\n",

I initially tried bumble because I had hoped there’d be fewer creepy guys here given that it’s all about woman messaging first, etc. Well, maybe a few years ago that was the case. Nowadays it seems like everyone wants an open relationship/hookup, or you’re matched with guys way outside your preferences. Even if you make a connection (and are clear you’re looking for long-term), most of the men will be looking for hookups. Many times messaging will fall flat, or you’ll connect and they’ll never respond to your first message and it will expire. On the brief chance that you do actually go out - 9 times out of 10 they’ll never contact you again despite trying to set up a second date. Dating prior to using apps would always lead to second and third dates, so I learned the hard way that it’s not me - it’s the kind of men who use these apps. Be warned. If you’re looking for a hookup this will work out for you, if not, save yourself trouble and heartache and try meeting someone in person instead.',\n",

First of all, I’m pretty sure the pricing for boost was raised, or at least the week trial was, I don’t remember it being 11 dollars. Second, they made it frustrating to get to the people that liked you (if you aren’t boost) I remember getting notifications for people liking me and then when I opened the app, they were one of the first cards that appeared in the swipeline and I matched. Now I’ve swiped until I reached my limit and didn’t find the people who liked me! so I have to wait until the next day. Which brings me to my third point, the limit. For some reason there’s a limit to how much you can swipe now, that’s got to be the worst change from this app so far.

It’s also very easy to filter people you aren’t interested in thanks to their preferences feature. Today though, Bumble exceeded my expectations. I reported a profile (first time reporting anyone) because I had met up with him after we agreed to hangout and talk. He was not who his profile said he was and he repeatedly tried to force himself onto me. I said no very clearly a bunch of times until he finally let me leave. After I reported his profile, Bumble immediately emailed me to ask if I was okay and said that they had blocked his profile from Bumble. I was simply reporting it just in case others had the same issue with this guy. Bumble actually listened and their response was really professional and thoughtful. It’s nice to know that they take safety so seriously! Thanks bumble!',\n",

If you do it with spotlight you most likely get 4-8. If you don’t pay for spotlight you are wasting your time. I’ve tried the speed dating multiple times without spotlight and checked every single person I’ve talked with and not a single match made. It’s clearly a scam which you’ll only get a match or two if you are paying for spotlight.\\n\\n2. Matches\\nAs I’ve said I’ve had this app for a month. I’m that month I only had one match. Just one! And pretty sure it was a fake account by bumble for false hopes to keep me using their app. I gave the person additional time but at least I go no answer.\\n\\n3. Profiles\\nUnless you pay can you get verified accounts but nothing says they aren’t fake accounts by bumble or other users. So unless you pay do you really have additional chances of meeting someone\\n\\nOverall:\\nI’ve used tinder before. Banned on day two like many others for posting memes. I wouldn’t recommend getting this app unless you don’t mind waiting an year of your life to get on here. I’ve got better chances of an real life match just going for it so bye bumble. Giving this five stars so I hope some that read this got some useful insight on how this app works.',\n",

My experience has been quite different. Yes women often say hello, and I will ask questions and attempt to get to know them. However, it seems reasonable to imagine that if a woman is really interested she might ask me a question about myself, or my experience. It’s also not accurate that women will even give out their number after several weeks of chatting and video calls. For many women finding a man that’s actually available it seems is their worst fear. I’m willing to pursue, and express interest, I don’t think it’s absurd to want a partner to also express a desire to be with me. Women on the app will report you for telling them you don’t think you guys are a match, all the while stringing you along with no intention of actually dating you. They are more than happy to get as many free meals as possible tho! What a sad state of affairs! As someone who actually wants to find partnership and communicate rather than just ghost people. This app is pretty absurd!',\n",

The way I see it, is that you should not have to pay large amounts of money to find love.   I’ve gotten to the point where I feel depressed about even getting onto these apps because at this point they are just straight up pointless.  Who wants to match with a pretty guy/girl just to end up getting ghosted or never even getting a date at all????    I even feel bad for my guy and girl friends who use these apps and just get the same results.  Please spare yourself the feelings of depression and a broken heart and use a dating app that only charges you once for access instead of charging you multiple times for a “premium subscription” or do what I do and go out into the world and meet people.

A had over 90+ people in my beeline each day and usually whittled it down throughout the day. My week ended and I kept using the app, matched with people regularly and everything was fine. A month or so went by and I bought a whole month of bumble boost. I then discovered that you can use filters to filter out anything, say you only wanted to look for people that prefer dogs, you can filter out people who only like cats, or lots of animals, ect. Well, i’m not sure if turning on the filters hides your profile from others with those selections, but i have only had like 9 people in total in my beeline since i bought the month boost. I don’t know if something is up with the algorithm or if it’s just a gimmick. It would be a great marketing scam if you made the first time customer rich with people in their beeline. Then when they come back to repurchase you starve them. Not saying that’s what happened, but something is up.',\n",

Within 24 hours of making my account i was permanently suspended and blocked for impersonation. The best part is that I already verified my photos in the app with their own verification system, what a joke. To go even further i sent an email asking what i could do because after all it is me in my photos. Whether it be send in my drivers license or a video etc. I got a generic copy paste response of course. I inquired further and got a message from a woman named sarah who told me that since 3 girls reported me as fake i was permanently banned and it was irreversible. She told me that all bans are looked through thoroughly and would never be overturned. I had my account for less than 24 hours and only had 4 matches.. they didn’t review anything at all. So if you’re a guy on bumble and 3 girls report you for any reason at all or just to troll you, then you are instantly and permanently banned no questions asked.

Either way, deleted account, won’t download again.\\n\\nEdit to developer response of the 24 hour rule being for “intentional conversation.” Clearly, they are not aware of people my age having busy jobs, children to take care of and overall not living on their phones 24/7. For an app that is supposed to empower women, all it did was make me feel bad about myself when no response was made when I went out of my comfort zone to start a convo. Still can’t recommend the app for anyone looking to have any sort of meaningful connection. If you want a hookup or polyamory, the app would probably work for you. Facebooks new match works quite well, give that a try.',\n",

Unfortunately it is not a requirement for everyone. So one could try to only choose verifiable “trustworthy” users, right? Sure but there are so few users in any given area you need to widen your search radius just to see any possible new matches. And you still have to deal with all the regular stuff: people may not be real or ever verify their posting. People are here just because they want instagram followers. People are gross, wanting to simply get off on Snapchat. People who match you respond with one or two syllables and then you don’t hear from them again, or the matches simply don’t respond at all, possibly because they are not paid subscribers. So, bumble is really no better than the typical apps that may actually be more popular with more users. And bumble is way expensive considering the experience you can expect to receive from your time/investment in seeking friends or dating. $$$$',\n",

They’ve severely limited the amount of swipes for “more consistent matches” but what they really mean by that is that unless you’re paying them, you’re going to have a very watered down experience. Dating apps should work for free users, and if they’re interested in making it work better, then they should pay. Instead, bumble no longer works for free users so pay them or else. That’s why you all aren’t seeing growth in paying users. If it doesn’t work for a new user, why in the world would they pay for it?

And each time I do so, I match with a TON of women from those cities where Im visiting then when I get home, they're like wait you don't live here?!  (in the city where we match) and Im like no I live such and such place and they're like I don't want a long distance relationship (even though Im always less than 3 hours away from where they live) and they say I deceived them or wasn't honest about where I live. And Im like, no the app stalked me and said my current city was Orlando or wherever I was that day, but I really live in Ft Meyers sorry about that.

So obviously Bumble doesn’t review their own terms and conditions or they need to be updated because I didn’t do anything outside of the guidelines. But then again they do require women to Message first so maybe they have a problem with women who still like the way things were done when relationships and marriages actually lasted and I don’t like beta men.',\n",

Used to be great because it wouldn’t show people outside of your search radius. Now, if you have beeline, it just shows you everyone who’s ever swiped right on you regardless of your location. I have people on my beeline who live in other states and the majority of them live way too far for me to want to invest in talking to them and meeting them. The worst part is beeline doesn’t even organize your bees in geographical order so I have to basically sift through bees until I find one that I am also interested in who also lives close enough to me to invest some time in. When I wrote bumble about this they told me this was helping people find better dates. For someone like me who works a lot and doesn’t have a lot of free time, I’d much prefer to be able to set a radius on potential matches. At least organize bees in geographical order!

       "  'review': 'I love bumble BFF but I would say that the dating mode is geared toward women who like to be in the driving seat, the more aggressive types. I have found a lot of men who date on bumble a little entitled passive lazy mamas boys and are used to dating women who do all the work. They typically enjoy the female attention.  (The dating mode puts women in the driving seat where they have to be the one to pursue and initiate conversation with men). I am old fashioned and have feminine energy rather than masculine so I don’t feel comfortable approaching men I might like and am used to being pursued, and the man doing all the work. So if you are that type of woman, bumble date may not be for you. If you’re a feminine type woman, you may prefer an app like hinge, where men pursue you and you have the option to decline any advances if you do wish. You also have the option on hinge to pursue men if you wish but there is more mutuality there than Bumble date.',\n",

However, this makes no sense at all given that swiping left/rejecting people actually counts toward your daily swipe limit. As a straight guy who is 5’5” and resides in California, 70% of the women I see on this app are at least 5’7” or above. For the most part, women are completely uninterested in dating guys shorter than them. Heck, I know girls who are 5’2” that won’t settle for a guy unless they are at least 6’ (which is honestly probably 5’10”, but still I’m way shorter than that). Thus, I feel it is UNJUST that Bumble forces me to waste swipes on girls who are taller than me whereas this would not be an issue for tall guys. This action to remove the advanced filters as a free option (at least the one for height) is borderline discrimination and is something that Bumble devs will not understand unless they talk to other short guys.

I feel that this company has algorithms that will give you likes and will open with hi to make you feel like you’re getting some activity. Once you really start using the app, all of a sudden there is never anyone in the local area. Everyone is always 20-30 miles a way and I live in a very populated city in Florida. I find this to be suspect. That’s not to that there are real people on here… but there are more fake profiles then real and the distance feature on the filter does nothing cause it’s either no one in the area(live in large city) or they only show people that live no where around you… enjoy the free app just don’t pay for anything!!',\n",

       "  'review': 'This app has some ups and downs. Biggest complaint is the swipe reset timer. Rather than resetting at a set time (i.e. midnight), you have to wait a full 24 hours from the time you ran out of swipes until you can resume. The fact that this hasn’t been addressed tells me it’s deliberate so that users are inconvenienced into paying for an upgrade.\\n\\nThe women choose format is kind of refreshing but it seems like a lot of women either don’t know how the app works, are too timid to actually “make the first move” (a.k.a. literally type/send one letter or more to enable a conversation) or just swiped for kicks thinking it wouldn’t actually match. So, as refreshing as the different approach may be, it leaves a bit to be desired in practice.\\n\\nThere a decent amount of active users in most areas, which is essential. Unfortunately, you have to pay to see if anyone is interested. That might not be so bad if it was a reasonable price but $30/mo  to find out a bunch of people you weren’t interested in liked you is a total ripoff.\\n\\nOverall, I’d recommend Hinge over Bumble or Tinder. Other services claim to care about your experience but monetize the crap out of critical features. Hinge, on the other hand, gives you all of that stuff for free. Yes, you read that correctly; they don’t make you pay to see who “likes you”. There may not be as many users but matching is far more effective.\\n\\nDo better Bumble. ✌🏼',\n",

We texted the whole two weeks and I made a cheesy wish at the Trevi Fountain right before mom and I left to come back home. \\n\\nA little over one year later my green-eyed guy and I went to Italy together and he proposed to me in front of the Trevi Fountain.

       "  'review': 'So I really liked the concept of being able to message someone if there was a match and not having to receive tons of unsolicited and sleazy messages from random “men”. I’ve had the app for a couple months now and figured I just wasn’t matching with anyone because I have received absolutely no notifications whatsoever. Even in the app there is no notification marker on the chat bubble icon. Yesterday I happened to make a match. I sent a message to my match to get a conversation started. A couple hours later I checked the app again and tapped on the chat bubble icon. It had no record of a message sent to my match from earlier AND was showing two matches that I had missed out on because 24 hours had passed. Then, Bumble wants a ridiculous amount of money to rematch. I think this is completely wrong and unfair to want to charge for a rematch when there was never even any notification of the matches in the first place. I’m ok with the 24 hour window, but only if notifications would actually be sent. But at this point I am extremely disappointed with this app.',\n",

The idea that women will actually make the first move is very intriguing I thought “this is a change that I like” as I don’t like making the first move it feels like I’d be the only one putting effort in as always. But I should’ve realized that women will only respond if you’re attractive or actually interesting looking. I don’t even know what beeline is, all I know is you have to pay for it and I don’t want to pay for the app on that chance that I get the same results as I did when I wasn’t paying for it.

Apparently I have two accounts and can’t log in to it to shut it down. But in the past month it’s happening very frequently. I often have guys disappear after I’ve matched with them but before I can message. A handful and you think ok they changed their mind or just swiped on all the women for an ego boost. But when it happens a dozen+ times in a week, it makes you go hmmm. Honestly it’s like there are a ton of glitches and they just don’t want to admit it. The new feature where Boost members see all people who’ve swiped them, even if they are 3000 miles away, makes paying for that service a waste of money. I’ve contacted Bumble help 4x and keep getting a canned response that doesn’t quite address my questions. I’m done asking them to have a thinking human respond.

I feel like that could be a real game changer because I don’t think there’s any dating app that has a feature like that.

Most of the people on this app are very superficial, insecure, immature, argumentative, flakey and difficult to get along with. For Bumble BFF, I’ve come across women who only want to grow their Instagram followers. Also met some friends who ended up being very flakey, unreliable, which led to very one sided friendships. Also emphasizing immature as these women are in their 30s and taking many pics “for the gram” as if they’re teenagers. Most of the girls I met had trouble making friends, and I now understand why: People are also very behind in their careers, so don’t expect to feel like your interacting with an adult. As for the dating, men are extremely picky. They want a supermodel, but don’t have good qualities themselves. If you don’t want to chat or date me, don’t then don’t right swipe on me. Lots of the men here have the most basic jobs or lie about their height, occupation, and post misleading photos.\\n\\nEdit: I downloaded this again, twice.

Secondly, the price for this app makes no sense for men to pay for. It is already set up so men cannot contact women first and now they want you to pay $40+ a month for what, to look at pictures?!? Last but not least, women do not traditionally reach out first when it comes to dating, so even if she were interested, she’s not going to make first contact so this app is counterintuitive.

       "  'review': 'Bumble used to be my favorite dating app by far. It’s layout was intuitive and it’s features were extensive. Most importantly, though, it’s recommendation algorithm was straightforward and geared towards getting users matches as quick as possible. I am not particularly deluged by likes on the app, but when I did have likes, those who liked me appeared at the beginning of the feed before anyone else. This was in stark contrast to tinder, where you can have many likes and have little idea where they will show up in your feed. Now, bumble is worse than tinder in this regard. I recently redownloaded and got around 20 likes in the first 48 hours or so but was only shown maybe 5 of them. This was far worse than tinder, which I recently redownloded as well. I’m very disappointed with bumbles decision to jump on the bandwagon and gone against its ethos of being the more ethical, user conscious app. This decision may make bumble more profitable, but it will come at the cost of user wellbeing😔',\n",

I googled to see if I was missing anything and I saw plenty of reviews stating the same thing was happening to them. \\nI updated my profile thinking it would help but nothing. \\nI noticed that if I purchased spotlight coins (addition to the monthly subscription), my profiles would get viewed. When I first created my profile, I was meeting people but not sure what is going on now ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ \\nAlso, I don’t like the 24 hour window for initiating first communication. If that 24 hour window is missed, the match/message disappears. Not sure about you but sometimes my life take over and I don’t check bumble every day.',\n",

I actually get plenty of matches, so that’s really great, but the only serious problem I’ve had is the 24 hour time limit on replies/reaching out. I had 17 matches yesterday, messaged all of them, and received only one reply. And I honestly don’t blame them for not checking the app/replying to my original message - it was a Saturday, and I would hope they would be hanging up and hanging out, as I was for most of my day. I also wouldn’t be writing this review if it wasn’t a consistent problem. This sort of thing happens all the time, no matter what time or day of the week. \\nSo I think extending the time limit to 48 or even 72 hours would seriously increase user response and the likelihood of people’s ability to talk to/meet someone. There are some solid guys I’ve matched with, but will never get the chance to meet because of the 24 hour time limit. Bumble 2020 needs to step this up.',\n",

May not seem like a huge issue but when you’ve taken the best picture of your life and would like to use it, it’s an issue. I actually had to pay someone a few bucks to reorient my image to portrait without distorting it in a photo editor. \\n\\nSecondly, you’re allowed almost 0 swipes. I swiped right on 5 people and ran out within 90 seconds and now have to wait another 24 hours.

I thought it was only $12 more since it was a promo advertised RIGHT after getting boost AND bc it said “only $12 more…” I think you could really improve the subscription options and clearly state them somewhere instead of having to dig through :( it was disappointing to see I was double charged too based on the messaging in the app. Was really confusing.',\n",

I do like it, I don’t like the fact that girls have to message first, and the match expires in 24 hours but it’s a cool concept I guess. I just wish matches didn’t expire. The only other thing I wish it had was a setting in BFF mode to find girl-friends. I don’t need any more guy friends. So I wish that would change. But overall I like it a lot better than Tinder, you can learn a little more about who someone is before swiping.

When I did not feel a connection I told him I was not interested and it wasn’t going to work out. Since then he had began to harass me with texts, I blocked him on all social media’s and he created multiple new accounts to get in contact with me. I have not answered him since early October. I am still receiving texts from him every other week. \\n\\nTHE MAIN REASON for this review is because he constantly keeps coming up as he super-liked me or just for me to swipe right or left. I have blocked and reported him on multiple occasions on bumble, I believe it might be around 7 times. I thought if I blocked/reported him he would stop popping up on my bumble. I really wish I did not have to see him anymore. The constant texts that are still being sent since October is enough. I really would like to not have to see him anymore on my bumble and it makes me uncomfortable to think he is still seeing my account. \\nAlso that he could possible be on here looking for someone else to harass. What he has been texting me is not of someone who is of sound mind.  I will not put names on here but please contact me bumble to rectify this situation. If not I will be deleting my account and advising others not to download because he is making the environment of bumble for me to feel unsafe.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I’ve used bumble in the past with great success. Never paid anything and have found multiple dates back in time 2018.  I took a long break from online dating and finally decided to return. (I used the same pictures as in the past) It’s clear the only goal of this app now is to generate cash flow. It’s sad and irresponsible. I decided to pay $10 for a week of premium just to test things out after nearly a three+ year break. Only a handful of matches. As soon as my premium ran out I received 10x as many likes as when I had premium. It’s 100% a scam, they want you hooked and paying so they slowly trickle matches along the way. Another good example of the way algorithms ARE NOT CONSUMER FRIENDLY. This app and this company relies on you NOT finding love. The longer they can string you along the better for their profit margins. You can pay nothing but the app will rarely if ever serve you up a match. It’s rigged and my recent payments have confirmed my suspicions, old bumble was fantastic. The “new” and evolved bumble is against you.',\n",

Maybe you realize you missed that they smoke cigarettes or don’t want kids or already have kids and it’s really frustrating. Oh unless you pay a buttload of money. I wish you could pay just a few dollars to use an advanced filter or whatever. \\n- unlike Hinge you have to pay to see who likes you. $20 per WEEK is the cheapest. \\n- if you’re a lesbian the app will completely disrespect that and show you profiles of men.

When you match with someone, the girl has to respond first, though this is not inherently a bad thing, the girls just don’t start a conversation when we match. For example, I matched with someone and then I had to wait until they started the conversation. They didn’t start it ever so I extended the time they had to match with me, and they still didn’t start.\\n\\nAll in all great app. But this one feature (though good in concept) is not good in practice. If I were to suggest an improvement to this I would say to either nix the entire idea or make it such that the second person to like has to start the conversation (so if I liked someone and later they liked me, they would start the conversation.

I have one complaint, lately bumble keeps sending me profiles of people states away. I have no interest in out of state dating as someone who values quality time. I have had so many out of state men swipe on me it’s frustrating and disappointing to find out they are not local.

I decided to give this one a try and even though their UI is pretty nice to look at and their concept is also interesting, their algorithm manipulates likes and matching in the most ridiculous way I’ve ever seen of all of these apps. I’ve been liking a bunch of people for the past 24hrs and still have ZERO matches. There are two options here. Either none of those people liked me back, or their algorithm isn’t showing my profile to anyone I’ve liked so far. Here’s the thing though… they’re claiming over 50 people have liked me, and I just have to pay for their premium to see them, because OF COURSE, any of those have shown up on my feed either. HUGE SCAM. Don’t waste your time or money.',\n",

I love the idea of an app where women get to message first, as they often are faced with a deluge of garbage of bad puns/jokes/explicit messages. Enter Bumble. Cool concept, but your matches only last for 24 hours. I get a lot of matches but a good majority of them expire, as what busy person checks the app every single day? Want to increase the time? Pay. Daily you get to swipe less than other online dating apps. Want more? Pay. And the prices? Hah. Might as well be paying a $40+ a month subscription or opt for the lifetime pass. Bumble is the only online dating app that I’ve seen so far where it would be better for my wallet to buy random ladies drinks at the local bar than attempt to use the app to its fullest through a subscription. Anyway, this close to uninstalling this thing and just spending time on alternatives to Bumble. Which is too bad, really, as I like the idea of it.',\n",

After that I don’t think I have received a single visit from anyone, and have yet to even chat with anyone(kinda disheartening if you ask me). Very interesting up until the point you run out of ‘bees’ from your desired area and then everything is around 60 or so miles away.  I may get 3 new people a day in my feed to even look at.

Be open minded and focus on the positive of every encounter and I promise you’ll find what you’re looking for. To the fellas, take this seriously.

Are non-binary people not also marginalized and disproportionately impacted by men’s violence, harassment, and unwanted advances? The fact that the company actively designed and invested resources in such a backwards and exclusionary update (while marketing itself as wanting to create a world where all relationships are healthy and equity and valuing inclusion) means it is completely out of touch with reality.

There’s plenty of people to connect with, and the 24 hour limit really encourages actually talking to your matches instead of just collecting them. That being said, I have noticed a couple problems. There’s an audio messaging feature, but when you try to listen to the messages, they constantly freeze and start over. So those are essentially useless. \\n\\nWhat bothers me the most, however, is the beeline. It’s way too easy to accidentally swipe left or right when scrolling up and down.

I guess they had to expand my preferences for that 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️ Seems like Bumble was holding out on me until the last of the three months I bought. I’m guessing it’s because their hopes are that I would get excited and I’d buy another three months if I didn’t become official with someone in this next month. Less likely you’ll become official with someone in one month rather than three. Seems a little dishonest to me. It’s otherwise a decent app, which is why it doesn’t get a one star.

A year ago, I had 30+ matches along with at least 50+ others waiting to get matched within my first two weeks of downloading the app. It was easier for me to find quality women than tinder at the time. However, now that I’m single again, I find the exact opposite. I’ve been on the app for a month and I have only 1 match and nobody waiting in the que...you’re probably thinking I’m too cocky, but I literally have the same pics on tinder and have a ridiculous amount of matches. I know for a fact that bumble is HIDING my matches. I know multiple people personally that use the app and have told me they have swiped right on me before but I’ve never seen them on there. It’s all a scam to get you to upgrade. They withhold matches to get that money, then from what I’m seeing from other reviewers, they may or may not release them. This is a joke now honestly, I’ll give it one more shot then I’m done with this trash.',\n",

This was certainly not the case. Not only is the premium subscription way more expensive than other dating apps, but they nickel and dime you for any type of interaction with somebody’s profile. Other dating apps allow you to comment on somebody’s profile to increase interaction and personability . Bumble charges per comment which actively discourages interacting with somebody’s profile. I think this is a huge flaw and makes it no different than Tinder for how you interact with it. \\n\\nAdditionally, I haven’t had trouble getting likes, matches, messages, and dates from people on other apps, but bumble was extremely disappointing.\\n\\nI like and dislike the ability to set filters for who I see.

Why won’t Bumble take this feedback seriously and change it back to make a huge improvement.

I kind of understand the intention when it comes to the dating aspect of the app, but the friend side should not have a limit!? And 25 is an insanely low number. Even on BFF, I only matched with 3 people in that day because most women add their Instagram handle and never return to Bumble, so that wasted a swipe right.. Additionally, I’ve read many articles about how difficult it is for people to find matches with this new update because people will let the time run out due to women needing to send a message first and potentially being nervous to make the first move (been there) (or because of the same Instagram issue mentioned above). I don’t believe this limit will help anything but Bumble’s income. Let people swipe right on 500 people per day if it adds to their chances of finding the right person.',\n",

There are profiles that are obviously using their profile as a political platform and not a dating one. There are guys who are looking for gay encounters that show up even if I apply filters. \\n\\nThat has more to do with the users and not the app itself but there are issues with the app too. The filter only lets you add what you are interested in rather than exclude something you don’t want. If I was able to check exclude “gay, polyamorous, non monogamist, transgender “ so I don’t spend to much time look through stuff I’m not interested in at all. \\n\\nThere is a left leaning culture in the app when it should be neutral, I’d prefer bumble not be political at all. If this was the app to empower women then it has lost it’s direction, because guys are able to keep there profiles as women, I find it disrespectful to women.

I’ve been thinking a lot about gender stuff recently (changed my pronouns to she/they on the app) and the new gender thing was a bit startling when it was clear it wasn’t optional to fill it out. So I had a mini existential crisis and tentatively selected non-binary and then gender questioning since that wasn’t an option under woman. Now I’ve matched with someone who selected “woman” and I can’t message her first because I’m questioning my gender and identifying as non-binary? This doesn’t make any sense. The idea is supposed to be that the less privileged gender can message first, yeah? So why can’t I, identifying as non-binary, message a woman first? Did you rank it? Highly recommend y’all reconsider this format. This is catering to cis straight women. It’s a weird flex when the only people encountering this issue will be queer people who don’t need or want y’all to decide who messages who first.',\n",

Throughout the day, I’d get notifications that guys were interested but when I’d check, no one was actually there. I’d get notifications that someone ‘superswiped’ but no one was there either. -so sad- Generally it got boring after a while to swipe endlessly. When I did get a response, it was hard to carry a conversation. I’m considering just saying ‘hi’ just to see if a guy actually swiped right! I know some criticisms from men were women just would say ‘hi.’ It’s tiring saying something substantial when no one responds! 😀 Anyways, I’ve come to the conclusion that if you have mainstream looks you would have a better chance at Bumble.

Please remove the feature of swiping left to right for replying to a message.

Alot of people do not have access to their phones every single day and or are able to check the app to see if you have matched. It would be great if the 24hr timer starts after you view the matched person’s profile.

I just wish that it was like 48 hours at least or even 36. it’s definitely not uncommon for me to forget to check the app for a day. and then anything that may have happened during that time is gone. i think alternatively having the timer start once the other person opens the app would be fine. because if i match and they don’t open the app for 24hrs then it’s gone. \\n\\notherwise a decent dating app. not complaints with anything else really. it’s just overdue for an update',\n",

Then about a month ago I randomly got a message saying I’m blocked from bumble for trying to solicit / sell something. I was really confused because none of my conversations had anything to do with that. I figured it was an accident so I messaged bumble customer service several times in the last month and they never got back to me. I’m still blocked for something I never did it was weird but luckily I ended up downloading hinge and found it a way better way to weed out people I wouldn’t want to be on a date with and find better connections. In just 3 weeks I’ve been on 4 hinge dates (I consider myself pretty picky) that went really well. I’m not trying to knock down bumble and advertise for hinge I just am really disappointed they didn’t get back to me a month later when it was clearly a mistake and I never tried to sell anything \\n\\nThanks for reading !!',\n",

In the month I had purchased it, there were a total of 10 likes that I could see. The DAY my membership ended and I could no longer see potential matches, 50+ likes appeared. Not only that, but suddenly there were hundreds more potential people to see and swipe through. It was like I was hidden (which I was wasnt) until the day I stopped paying. What an absolute scam to take your money, then a con-job to get you to re-up for another month. It was like they loaded up on hidden matches just to get you to pay for a membership again. I matched with 10 people alone the day after but not one of them initiated a conversation and they all expired so who knows when, over the course of the previous month that my profile was limited to others, that they swiped right on me.

Bikini pics allowed outside, but you better be wearing a shirt in that pool if you’re a man? Nice double standard.

I think maybe you should be able to extend another 24 hours for free or something. Maybe add a feature that is a daily reward for logging in or something to help out the Men who can’t message the woman who have matched with them and messaged within the 24 hour. However, I’ve gotten a lot of matches as a male which I’m proud of. My advice to other males, just be honest and take time to put in information about yourself that is true. There’s no point in wasting time. I also like how bumble is designed. If a woman messages me, it reinforces my confidence to know that she actually wanted to talk to me. So, great job bumble for that mechanic!',\n",

My only complaint is that the UI is absolutely atrocious. 90% of the time I find myself trying to scroll up and down through someone’s profile and the app mistakes it for a left or right swipe. It’s very inconvenient when trying to gather the appropriate information in order to make that final decision. If it mistakenly swipes left on someone you think may be compatible, you can’t back track without paying an outrageous subscription fee per WEEK (scam). On the other hand, if it mistakenly swipes right on someone who doesn’t quite peak your interest (and you were to pay the premium) you can’t back track because it’s “not very nice”. Probably won’t see any changes or improvements but it’s worth putting out there for anyone interested in using the app.',\n",

I’m convinced they use an algorithm to keep you on the app and to keep paying because it says I have 2950 likes and then when I got a subscription I only had 500. I thought maybe it was bc it narrowed down my matches based on my filters (which they didn’t used to charge for but now do, freaking lame)! Once my subscription ran out however, I was matching with guys that met my requirements so it doesn’t really make sense. Also, their sub prices are completely random. I found out a friend was paying $60 a mo while I was only charge $40. And this was month to month, our package deal offerings were considerably different as well. This app is a rip off and a waste of time. And don’t get me started on the gross “sex positivity” interest they just added. Men don’t know the point of it but I guess it’s a good way to filter out pervs and time wasters.',\n",

Because my settings and my profile picture was also reverted back to what it was originally before I started talking to her. As if turning off the phone just deletes everything you did. Same thing ended up happening with a friend of mine when her phone died so it’s not just me.\\nHer last message was “What’s your Snapchat” and our conversation went great. Unfortunately the conversation disappeared and we could not exchange any information to contact outside of bumble.\\nI contacted bumble and they could not do anything about it.

I matched with someone who pretended to have one persona within the app, then immediately harassed and insulted me using racial slurs while attempting to coerce me into a situation I was uncomfortable with.

I even tried using the premium service a bit (which is still active until the end of the month) and I’ve had no luck.

       "  'review': 'Bumble is definitely erring on the side of misandry (the opposite of misogyny). Women have to begin the conversations, but I’m not sure how many women realize that. The number of times women will swipe right on you and never message you is staggeringly high. They would never let a man undo his right swipe because “we’ve already told them you like and that would be rude!” But women can right swipe, see the match and immediately delete the match. \\n\\nYou know how women on most sites will say “don’t start the conversation with just a “hey” “hi” “sup””? Well that’s exactly what women do on here. And the profiles that say “I’m looking for someone who can actually hold a conversation” are the worst at it. Like the actual worst. It would be laughable if it weren’t so frustrating. \\n\\nAlso, they don’t have a specific trans section. So don’t be surprised if you swipe right on someone only to find out they are trans. It’s fine to be trans, but the section is looking for women not looking for trans women. Maybe the devs could make a separate area for that, but no, you just have to hope they are being honest before you ask them out. And watch out for the girls just advertising for their only fans. \\n\\nI get what devs want to accomplish by setting it up differently, but they have basically failed and made it a place where women can swipe and flake out with zero consideration for others.',\n",

I believe they make you pay for the app and then never will approve your picture so they can keep your money you put into it. So far that has been my experience. I will not make a new one for the same thing to happen so I have to do the whole process again. I only had the profile a week and I paid for a month, can’t view my profile until it approves my picture. Again I would say that is great but it never approves the picture.',\n",

However, I have some suggestions.\\n\\n1) PLEASE add options for ethical non-monogamy. OkCupid has this in spades and I see where some people have wasted their time on a match that doesn’t actually match with them. It’s simply because the question was never asked and it takes up real estate in the limited profile space.\\n\\n2) The profile is very limiting. There’s something to be said for “less is more”, but when all you get is three pictures and two sentences, it’s just not much to go off of. We only get to list five interests? I have DOZENS. I understand not wanting things to get too cluttered, but please give me more room to work with.\\n\\n3) I would love an option to rate profiles, especially when I’m swiping left. I don’t need to be able to send more than one message. But sometimes I wanna say, “Hey, I’m swiping left because I don’t meet your boundaries, but thank you for being so honest and clear about those boundaries. I wish you luck.” Or sometimes, “Hey, I like you, but I’m swiping left because your profile is super unclear and I couldn’t tell anything about your interests or your boundaries. Just a tip.”',\n",

Not smart. Bummer as it was a good concept.\\n\\nUpdate:  Bumbles response below is a lie - you get about 10-20 swipes for free which makes Bumble useless in any town above 2000 people; i.e. you have to pay.

Going through parenthood and realizing how fate (and Bumble) brought us together helped us fall in love. We now are raising one beautiful son together and couldn’t be happier. Thanks Bumble!!! 🐝💛',\n",

       "  'review': 'For a company that runs on empowerment of women they show it in an idiotic way. For starters, this app started off as a fun way to meet new people but they do an awful job at replying back to commentary on the lack of background checks, feedback on certain men on the app, and they also changed a lot in their app which calls forth having to pay to unlock certain features. They have features to report but never get back to you, there is also the ability to remove the people who are weird but again it would be great and helpful if those who worked in the company came up with a strategy to get rid of the creeps. I also don’t condone supporting apps who don’t speak about crimes done to women from meeting on their apps. I feel like there’s a lot of corruption not only in the app but with the ones who oversee it as well. Just a heads up and be safe when being on dating apps that lack security :-)',\n",

And what’s worse is that the app doesn’t tell the girls that they have to make the first move so they don’t even know that they have to. So you can match with so many people but nothing happens because the girls don’t message first and you’re stuck. This setting is sexist if I’m being honest. 9 times out of 10, guys make the first move when it comes to flirting. So the fact that as a guy you can’t message first is really annoying. You end up losing the match for good after 24 hours so what’s the point. Most of the girls profiles that I see all say for the guys to message first!

I feel like I’m throwing myself at people who aren’t interested. \\n\\nI know Bumble is supposed to empower women, but having pictures taken down and making us beg for someone to talk to us does the opposite. Also, I had a photo taken down that Bumble thought was inappropriate, I was in a bodysuit, but never wanted the whole picture shown, just the top where it looked like a shirt. I thought I cropped it, but I guess you can’t crop on Bumble. It was taken down, but I feel like, as adult women we should be able to put anything we want on our profiles, as long as we’re covered. I felt like they put a red A on my chest that day. I think nude pics or pics of body parts should be monitored and users who do that should be kicked out.

       "  'review': 'This app is no different than any other dating apps. I’ve been on this app for nearly 4 months. I did get four females to like my profile but being a non-paying subscriber I could not see who they were unless payment was made. So I bit the bullet and paid for one week so I could see who liked my profile and maybe we could match. What a disappointment. Of the four likes three of the females were over 250 miles away and the fourth one was in another state. I live in a small town 35 miles away from a major metropolitan city and to get likes from so far away is just totally b. This is Bumble’s way of manipulating non-paying subscribers to pay. They will dictate who you match with. I’m know there are a few non-paying males that have matched but those are very, very few just so Bumble can good ratings. Don’t waste your money and time. Just go out physically and meet someone instead of wasting your time on dating apps.',\n",

I can go months without being on bumble and come back to barely any action.

On other apps I get way more likes, matches, and dates than when I use bumble. I feel like the main reason is they literally nerf everybody until you pay a crazy fee.

Where’s as with Bumble, you may match with a 10 women, talk to 5 women and actually meet one or two for a date.\\n     I also think it’s kinda funny, because on Tinder women will write in their profiles “Don’t just say ‘Hi’ or ‘Hey’, I won’t respond.” But then on Bumble women will say ‘Hi’ and ‘Hey’ when you match.

Not only do they have crap rules like the girl must message first and there’s a 24 hour time limit before your match expires and you have to pay money to get it back. Not only do they have stupid rules, but you then have to pay money (also the most expensive out of all the apps) just to have the regular features of the other dating apps. Their notification’s also come late and inconsistently. I’ll get a notification that I suddenly have 3 messages sitting in my inbox and when I go to check it the messages will be from multiple days prior. They really try to screw you with their time limits and lack of notifications so that you are forced to pay to use the app. I really don’t get the point of this app and it’s unnecessary rules.

I don’t sift through my messages or plan my next move on it. Swipes should be unlimited and totally free, and the fact that they are not makes it now seem like a waste of time and of space on my phone. Will probably delete soon if this doesn’t change, as there’s no point trying to make friends if I can only waste my few swipes a day on accounts that aren’t even active.

For the last 3 years or more you’ve able to select up to two different “advanced filters” for no cost. However with the latest update now in order to get any “advanced filters” you either have to pay $20 every week or $40 every month. I understand Bumble like any other corporation wants to make a higher profit, but I think being able to get two “advanced filters” or even just one is reasonable. After this change it makes me no longer want to use this app anymore, if I’m gonna pay for a dating app I would rather pay for a higher quality app like Eharmony.',\n",

I also realized that it’s way easier to approach men than women, even over the internet. Even if you make the first move, its  very hard to keep a conversation going and get past small talk.

It’s a really dumb design if this is intentional. The other bug is I can’t undo a left swipe even though I am supposed to be able to with premium, which is extremely easy to do accidentally while scrolling. The video interface is a great idea but doesn’t work. I haven’t tried it in a while to be fair. Other than the poor execution, this has the best matches, filtering (in theory), and interface.',\n",

Bumble used to allow what felt like 50 swipes a day and they’ve reduced it to maybe 15 swipes before they say you’ve hit the end of the line. They also had a really cool feature that tinder don’t even have which allowed you one back track which came in super handy if you mindlessly swipe and realize you wanted to learn more about someone. Like all good things they took that feature away and locked it behind a paywall. \\nThe apps intentions are in the right place but they have made it so disadvantageous for guys that it’s legit not worth. Simple economics, when a substitute good is both cheaper and a better quality then the demand for your good is going to decrease.

Then  after a brief encounter the robo match stops communicating with you. The objective is so that you get a feeling of potential connections and it also releases the site of any fraud claims by showing that there was activity between you and other would be members. The bottom line is don’t bother paying to use these apps, because at the end of the day you don’t know if the person you are communicating with on the other end is real or fake especially if you have no way to tell if they are in fact on-line or a computer generated profile.',\n",

       "  'review': 'At one point in time Bumble used to be the sweet haven from the Tinder world. However, thanks to price gouging and whatever algorithm Bumble is under, it seems so far off from what it once was. For the past couple weeks I’ve had dozens of “bees in my hive” which I couldn’t see specifically, since I didn’t pay for any premium services. I decided after getting virtually no matches that I was going to try something. I expanded and also shrinked my location perimeters and standards for what I was looking for on the app and swiped right on everyone until I ran out of likes… 3 days in a row. Not one match… It seems Bumble is in the business of keeping you hooked to swiping and not actually matching with the people who swiped right on you. I refuse to give this app any of my money and for the ridiculous prices they list, you’d be a fool to. I’m not that desperate for affirmations. I’ll stick to the bar scene.',\n",

So I guess if, say your match has their notifications turned off or can’t message you right away when you happen to match, then they’re gone. You can extend the time they have to message you but I feel like it would be simpler if sexist rules weren’t in place restricting conversation on an app made for having conversations.

But please give women the choice to have the men initiate first.\\n————————\\nIn response : I know Bumble wants to challenge the gender norms but I think if it hurts women in their dating experiences, then challenging the norms is NOT pro- women, it’s actually against women. I am suggesting giving women the choice whether they wish to make the first move or not. Most women like many of the features but would prefer that men make the first move.

From what I’ve heard about other sites, a lot of guys either can’t hold conversations or are looking for one thing that most ladies are not interested in. That weeds out the d-bags!  With this system, women get so many choices of who to respond to, possible good matches for them are buried at the bottom as new ones continue to flow in. After a few months, I think I’ve had maybe ten matches (yes aim attractive and I’ll admit I’m picky) but only 30% even respond, then they get bombarded with other matches before we even get to know each other. Fix the system, it’s a waste of time for the guys.',\n",

I love the idea that girls have to start the conversation and they have time limits so you are more motivated to actually chat & meet people.

It sounds easy and simple but so many times I have accidentally swiped left/right while scrolling a persons profile. It shouldn’t be so sensitive. The app needs improvement on this and should separate looking at a profile and swiping yes/no on a person. I would give this app more stars if I had better control of swiping yes/no.

Update: my photo has been moderated 7 times today for me in a long crop top with high waisted shorts and a button up. I’ve sent appeals to these moderations as well as an email regarding my review with nothing yet. I’m really getting tired of feeling objectified and sexualized on this app. - finally received a response and the actual issue wasn’t even discussed',\n",

I’ve used thousands of apps on iOS since it’s inception and I can honestly say this is the worst value of any app I’ve used from the App Store. I’m not just saying this because I can’t ‘get a date’, I’m happily talking to multiple people outside of this app. It’s just a terrible value all around in my opinion.\\n\\nYou will constantly see matches in your ‘Bee line’, which is supposed to show you people who have liked you before you have swiped left on them. The problem is people just swipe left on everyone and by the time you look at the ‘bee line’ they have already deleted you from their queue. This was a feature that convinced me to try premium and it’s completely useless as such.\\n\\nThe app is constantly pushing you to use its premium features,  and things like ‘super swipes’ are too easy to accidentally engage with no way of reversing it. I found myself using up premium things like ‘boost’ and ‘super swipes’ by accident and no way to restore or undo it. Support from the company is severely lacking considering the premium cost is a whopping $32 a month.\\n\\nThe app renewed yesterday and even though it charged me another $32, I’ll be removing it. It’s just not good for me. Perhaps you’ll have better luck with it.',\n",

The fact that you have to pay to backtrack tells me that this UX failure is a cash grab. \\n\\n -Algorithm seems more randomized and less tailored to your preferences/key words, making the app a bigger waste of time. \\n\\n-Comments/compliments cannot consistently be left on profiles without paying.\\n\\n Hinge suffers from none of these cons, and yet Bumble gives no good reason for you to tolerate the tradeoff of using Bumble instead of Hinge. Don’t waste your time with this app. If this review gets a canned/automated response from Bumble that merely provides some support link and doesn’t DIRECTLY address and discuss each of the above points, as well as explain why I should choose them over Hinge, it’ll be overwhelmingly clear to you, dear reader, that Bumble would rather stick to a script than actually process and understand what was said here.

I feel bad for the people writing reviews who spent money on an app they were already banned from using.\\n\\n(Also don’t use pictures with snapchat captions, through troubleshooting I’m fairly certain that’s why I was shadowbanned)',\n",

Maybe they’re moving to Hinge, I’m not sure, but I wasted my money by moving to Premium. Very disappointed at the drop off. I like Bumble and the idea of it, which is why I gave it a 3/5, but premium is a waste of money. I won’t be re-upping my subscription. 1 match in 4 days…on Hinge I’ve gotten way more…sad\\n\\nUPDATE: I have gotten a new match and it seems pretty promising, so I’ll bump it up to a 4.

One man who was a nurse from NYP put his his profile summary that he was HIV negative (and this was the only thing he put in his profile). When I messaged him that it would be more positive if he put his interests and hobbies instead he then sent me snapshots of messages he sent to his friends making fun of me. Just the violation of my profile being discussed with people other than the person I matched with has completely turned me off Bumble. I reported him and I hope he is banned. Bumble does nothing to mitigate this type of behavior because men get a huge ego boost from women messaging them on this app. Bumble continues to market this as “we empower women”. However, clearly from this experience, it is the complete opposite. It’s sad that Bumble mindlessly pushes the same message over and over again at the expense of women just so they can make money.',\n",

Having women make the first move was a nice idea but it didn’t work so well. I have found very few men that want anything else- even with the filter wanting a relationship. It’s a nice thought, the filters, but they don’t even work. Men put what women want to hear on there and then immediately ask for Snapchat or to meet for hookups. 🙄\\nTo top it off, now you can’t even keep swiping! It stops you after a certain number and says “that’s all for today” and you have to PAY to keep swiping! How absurd! What the heck? You’re giving me men that don’t even all have the filters I have set and then won’t let me keep swiping past them? Obnoxious.',\n",

I'm often called handsome, not to be big-headed, but something is fishy about your matching process. \\n\\n-today's update won't even load the app on my iPhone SE. I had a few matches that I'm sure I'm burning up because I can't respond. Thanks Bumble!\\n\\n-makes me swipe same people over and over again :(\\n\\n-when you press and hold a phone number it should bring up a menu to text/call/create contact but instead starts calling them right away. No bueno. I want options. \\n\\n-also can highlights and copy info from someone’s profile like their ig name or whatever 👎🏻\\n\\n-when sending and uploading pics, let us crop and size them ourselves instead of cutting everything off! :-/\",\n",

I love the amount of prompts that you can answer and put on your profile and overall the layout is really nice and easy to use. However, in my personal opinion, the good doesn’t necessarily outweigh the most annoying part of this app; I can barely do anything unless I have a bumble subscription. While I understand needing to make profit through the option of a subscription, what I don’t understand is why it’s $45 A MONTH. Im a college student just trying to find friends so there’s no way I can afford that! That’s more $$ a month than what I pay for my phone plan 💀.

And then on top of that, they put a limit on the number of people you can swipe on to try and match with and also made it so that if you accidentally swipe on someone who you’re not interested in, you now have to pay money to even do the “reverse swipe”.  They’re claiming they are encouraging “mindful swiping” but please, it’s hit or miss on whether the person will even respond to you, so I feel like the more you can match with someone, the more your chances of finding anyone are.  Just seems like they are basically trying to force you to buy a subscription bc that is literally the only way you are even really able to do anything on this app.',\n",

They have three options to filter out what a person is looking for which which include dating, friends, and business networking. Most people use bumble dating but don’t actually go on dates because most of the users are robots or people extremely far away from you, but mostly robots. I even called them out on this and haven’t heard a valid response, instead I think they gave me a warning or something like that. Woman making the first move seriously limits a person’s ability to make a connection as it’s simply not practical. That mixed with bots and the constant push notifications just to be let down has led me to hate this app. People shouldn’t use bumble (let alone pay for it) as it is a waste of time.',\n",

Its like they know no one is watching so they’re openly putting it in the profile, and often times in the first line of their profile. As a user paid, or free - we shouldn’t have to do your job and look for a potential partner too. How are you people allowing this to happen?! So it begs the question. Is this app for single people looking for a partner, or married people looking for an affair.  It’s hard enough being single. We don’t need people like this making it harder. Also making it mandatory to respond to the weather the person is married and if they have kids should be mandatory. Just do better.',\n",

This makes it challenging for people who don’t easily pass as one of the binaries to use the app. It seems like the issue could be easily solved with a third option - choosing to be shown to people “looking for everyone.” Everyone who uses the app has to specify if they are interested in “men,” “women,” or “everyone,” so it seems like there should be a pretty straightforward matching data set.

Today, I get into the app and see I have over 50 likes and I’m thinking this is weird when yesterday I only had a few. Bumble makes you pay to see who you match with and I currently don’t pay for that perk. So I start swiping and notice that a lot of these men are conservatives even though I specifically have my account set to match with only liberals. I go into my settings and try to set that again and now I’m being told I have to PAY to set that filter when it was free just yesterday. Bumble quietly got rid of this option in order to force people to pay money in order to have a decent experience. I will be deleting my account because I have no use for a dating app where I can not set specific preferences',\n",

The left/right swipe motion seems way more sensitive than the scrolling, and there’s no way to really eliminate that problem as a Bumble user in my experience. There used to be a way to go back to the person you just swiped left on once, but even that was a band-aid solution for a more serious annoyance that can cause some really uncomfortable situations having to explain the mistake or else quickly unmatch. Other apps have more responsive ways to show interest in a person, but these don’t have nearly as many users as Bumble.',\n",

When setting up the dating and bff profiles, the app assumed I was male and kept treating me as such. I don’t want to be identified as male on a dating and friendship app, I want to be identified with my proper gender identity. Even if the app gives me an option to say I’m non-binary, it does not give me the option to request that the app matches me with people who are looking for non-binary partners, only male or female. The bff mode is not helpful either as I’m looking for more than just male friends. I understand harassment is an active issue on every app but it’s forcing me to fit in a gender box I am uncomfortable conforming to.',\n",

After using every single one, I still have not received ANY likes (I’m an average looking dude), and throughout the month of me using Bumble, I currently have only had only one filter in place that has not been very exclusive.

Once daily you can comment on a specific aspect of someone’s profile, and leave a comment. It’s a great feature, and makes the app more personal. Then suddenly one day you try to compliment and it says “0 compliments left”, and the next day its the same. The app keeps having popups about “leave a compliment!” And when I click on it, it shows this whole interface as if I am supposed to have a compliment, but in the corner it still says 0 remaining.

They wouldn’t be overwhelmed with matches unless they send out tons of likes and men would then receive more likes (well, some men).

I understand its hard to screen for scams but its the same as the other apps at this point just with a higher price tag. The app is a great idea but $22 a week for a trial period is nuts.

It might be better to show all the singles in the area in a set of thumbnails, so you can always go back to someone’s profile. With the carousel, you are pressured to make a decision there and then based on very minimal info. Since there’s a character limit on the bio part of the profile, then maybe display  indicators like “smoking: yes/no, drinking: yes/no” etc so we know more about the people we’re matching with right off the bat. Otherwise, great app. Simple UI, okay instant-messaging system, plenty of users. I love how it has that BFF and Business features too. Would certainly recommend this app to my girls :)',\n",

I don’t get many likes, nor many matches, but it feels more honest. That matches I’ve made led to good conversations, and getting to know cool people.

However our social climate has completely changed people on bumble might not just be the “women” im looking for. (seperate issue) When swiping or getting likes i’ll match with plenty of women or “women” enough as it is but only 1/5 matches will ever turn into conversation because they don’t respond first and you have to end up paying to keep the match there if it’s someone you’re interested in. Personally it makes me think why not just have the timer count down for the “woman” to make the first move and after that you’re given a change to talk to them. Bumble can’t be that blind to the real world social aspect of dating interaction to where they seriously think the match rates and actual conversation rates are in any way similar🤷🏿\\u200d♂️',\n",

Then, whom you can’t see (bait) who they are until you pay into a subscription. Then upon signing up, you get hit with even more “likes” (for the first day, more bait) to tweak your emotions (whom are either not real people or hired hands) They don’t reply to a message or it’s just a simple aloof hello messaged with no further correspondence. Amidst this you may connect with ppl to converse which ends up being a waste of time. These apps totally take advantage of the consumer like slot machines. the greater percentage of subscribers are left with no match. research the stats. Spotlight and Superswipes are waste of money.

You’ll get unlimited swipes, however it doesn’t matter because most of the girls are there for attention and probably won’t respond. Especially girls with social media handles. Dm them on those social medias. if they don’t respond, move on. 2. You’ll get to see who swiped right on you, sounds promising right!! Only thing is the ones swiping on you ain’t so great looking. You might get a couple of good looking girls, but overall 3/4s. That’s pretty much it from my experience. Also, woman aren’t gonna make the first move. They rarely do. Only thing to add is jus match and plan a date don’t waste time on conversations through text. If they aren’t willing to meet up jus move on. Hope this helps the boyz',\n",

You have to swipe right or left to even see anyone else. Sometimes I wanted to think about it. And knowing that if they swipe back, I only have 24 hours to write to them meant I had to really think about swiping if I had a busy day coming up\\n* Women always writing first seems like a great idea but it just bites. Once there’s mutual interest, either person should be able to write\\nOnce you swipe, you can’t I swipe or see who you swiped on. I accidentally swiped right more than once then felt like a jerk when the person swiped back \\n*Deleting your account doesn’t  cancel your subscription.

Making matters worse in my opinion, they clearly would rather charge you to fix mistakes than design a better UI. For example if you accidentally decline a match, it is possible using the paid tiers to “undo” that swipe (although it is not possible to undo a right swipe, even if you wanted to go back to actually see the profile). This sort of design leads me to believe that the ease of accidentally activating super swipes is likely intentional design, not an oversight.',\n",

You get about 15 free likes a day to “promote thoughtful swiping”. It doesn’t really promote that though because it just leads you to closing the app. If you are currently feeling like you’re in a state of mind where you wanna pay that fee for dating apps please consider therapy first and then go to tinder (6 months for $23) or Hinge. Skip bumble. Review is from a woman, not a disgruntled man ☺️',\n",

Give us space to write!\\n\\nUpdate: others have mentioned this too, so I will chime in. The way this app handles locations is really terrible. I live in a city five miles east of Seattle. If I am at home, 100% of this app’s matches are in Seattle, most of them between 10 and 15 miles away, despite the fact that there are almost 6 highly populated cities closer than this. If I use the app even 1 mile north of home, it behaves perfectly and suggests people much closer to where I actually live. Your location algorithm is quite awful',\n",

Now (I believe after the same company that owns Tinder acquired Bumble) the app has been ruined. Almost universally, all recent reviews show how bad this app has become. Their algorithm is now seriously tweaked to PREVENT matches, or even to show your profile to anyone else unless and until you pay for extra features, and according to other reviews, even then you still get nothing. Complete waste of time even trying to use this app now. Feels exactly like tinder but with a slightly different UI.',\n",

I contacted bumble support multiple times about getting my account back only to receive computer generated emails and never getting any type of message from a real person. I later tried to make a new account but it was immediately removed, the same thing happened with any other attempts. This leads me to believe that I was banned but I have absolutely no idea why because I’m certain I did not break any of the community guidelines. It’s extremely frustrating for one, getting banned out of nowhere and two, not receiving any reason as to why I was banned in the first place.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The idea of Bumble seems great, but I find the app very buggy on the iPhone 6. The first few people you get to rate seem to be the best matches, but if you make a mistake, there’s no going back. Supposedly you can backtrack to correct a mistake but only after swiping right and left a bunch of times, after you’ve already passed all your best matches. Sometimes I swipe right and have no opportunity to write the person. They just disappear. Sometimes I can’t decide and then the person disappears before I get a chance to swipe. Online dating is confusing enough without feeling like the app doesn’t work right. Also when I try to pay, it doesn’t work, even though I can pay for all other apps with my fingerprint.',\n",

The app is free to start but unless you pay $500 or so a month you’ll barely get anywhere with it. Bumble has also become a place mostly for hookups, as you can only filter by location based on where someone currently is - not approx. where they actually live - in case you’re looking to have a “good time” that night. I recommend: in person speed dating events, meetups, single events, for actual dating. Dating apps really should never have become a thing. It’s kind of weird when you think about it. There are plenty of those other events, just do a google search for them in your area. Even hiring a personal matchmaker is better, and probably less money!',\n",

I read the responses to others complaining and Bumble says “you don’t need to pay to match” but putting a limit on swipes and needing to reset it 24 hours kind of makes that untrue in my opinion. \\n\\nIt’s honestly not great UX the way they’ve implemented it as well.

Now suddenly I’ve “run out of likes for the day”..unless, of course, I want to pay. It’s also incredibly easy to accidentally swipe left but if I want to backtrack, again, I have to pay.

Their personal biases affect how they enforce their rules and some of you may have experienced this with other social media/dating apps where the majority of their workforce are liberals with these same prejudices. \\n\\nRead the guidelines yourself as I have.

I think I had better conversations with potential matches. The reason I gave three stars is I fond the profile navigation and contact leave a lot to be desired. It automatically renewed when I didn't want to and they don't respond at attempts to contact them. I'd probably give 3.5 stars if I could.\", \"App will slow drastically when you start a chat with someone or pay for the 24hr beeline option. Makes it very difficult to have a decent conversation. You will get notifications stating that someone 'super swipped' or such, but when you click on the notification it doesn't take you to the profile. Pretty much everything is pay to play. There are better apps out there in my opinion. Edited to add: also noticed that when I did get into the Beeline, over 75% were out of the range I preset.\", \"Bumble used to be good until you had to start paying for it. I don't get as many matches as i once did. I paid extra to see who already swiped right on me, but I can't even message them. It keeps giving me an error message. When I pay for a week's subscription, I still don't get that many matches. It absolutely sucks. Don't even bother with this app. You also have to wait 24 (feels like more) hours before you can start swiping right on people. Unless you pay extra. Such a scam.\", \"No customer service! I have premium and I'm not getting any of the features. No free super swipes, no free spotlights. I've messaged them about 10 times, and there's absolutely no reply from their tech department, or customer service . Not recommended! Do not believe the tech support that are answering below. No one has ever reached out to me and it's been like 3 months of complaints. This app is complete waste of time and money, do not bother with it\", \"Absolutely, unequivocally, useless. Swipes are even more limited than they used to be and are cut off in a seemingly arbitrary manner. The introduction of compliments and best bees seemed like a good idea but they've throttled that to pointlessness as well. I made the mistake of paying for the app ONCE and it made no difference.\", \"This app is turned into a straight-up money-making scam. It's gotten to the point where I can pretty much predict exactly what's going to happen. Because I don't live in a major city I get little to no matches. But every so often I'll match with someone who seems almost perfect. They won't message in the first 24 so I'll extend it and they still won't message with 48 and then it just disappears. I tried to do the speed-dating thing but nothing ever popped up and it just keeps asking me to pay\", \"I used the app for about one year and had a few decent dates out of it. However, as soon as my paid membership expired, literally overnight, I went from having zero people interested in me to 47, of course being prompted to go back to the paid version. Didn't change location or filters during that time, so obviously, they are manipulating the truth and the end user.\", \"If you want it, use it for free and don't pay for this. Not worth the money. I get way more recommendations on tinder, and I've noticed that there are profiles with the same pictures but different descriptions, and they pop up one after another. Legit ... as for the speed dating, even with premium you get 2 matches, at most.\", \"I've been a Bumble user for a while, and recently, I experienced a concerning issue with the billing system. My account was charged twice within a week for a one-week subscription, which feels like an unnecessary and unfair overcharge. I've reached out to Bumble support for a refund, but the response has been slow. No use, no refund\", 'You guys really need to get rid of having to pay to see who swiped on you, I get you have to make money but that\\'s the one thing that keeps people who can\\'t afford a payment from finding a potential match. Get rid of that and this could be one of the better dating/friend finding apps out there. Also, having a \"show people from the same province/state only\" option wouldn\\'t be a bad idea either.', \"The major issue with bumble is the girl/woman has to message first. Even with extending for 24 hours. If she doesn't come on the app you lose the match. At least give guys the option to message first to keep matches active beyond 48hrs. Also free option to allow users to choose whether to show profiles with or without kids would be great. Instead of paying an expensive subscription just for that one option. Perhaps allowing 2 free filters could be a suggestion to improve the app experience.\", \"Horrible, low quality app. Inarguably, this is a piece of shite app. At home, you are bombarded with spam and fake profiles that drain the small number of free swipes you get. If you're traveling, you can't adjust the distance. Your matches could be so far away that there's no point in connecting with the person. Bad design. Super spammy. It's a public company. Crossing my fingers for a speedy path to bankruptcy. This is a bad company.\", \"Obviously over the years dating apps have had to change in order to make money. But this experience is just awful So I accidentally swiped left on someone who turned out to be a match! Okay, fine, I'll pay the few bucks so I can go back. Well, she never messaged back. Fine, I get it. BUT, unlike previous non pay times I get a bunch of matches all of a sudden. Normally they would show in a few swipes. Not now, pushed all the way down. Plus too many dudes pretending to be woman. It's not worth it\", \"It feels like a scam that I keep falling back into. When you pay to be able to swipe through more profiles, suddenly they take longer to load, if they load at all. You have 10 matches you can see, then it expires and there are suddenly 50 profiles you cant. And to top it off, you are barred from swiping having met your limit from the paid for unlimited swiping...instead of having a reset profile. Seems shady to me. Never pay for it. It isn't worth it.\", 'This app is literally a scam. I have seen the superswipe skip a number on more than occasion. One second I have 3 superswipes left, the next I have one. 2 compliments were previously available every week if you were a premium member. Now they have bumped up the pricing and removed compliments altogether (unless you pay for it, unsurprisingly). Not even going to address the algorithm because not once has the \"best bees\" been even slightly accurate. Canceling my subscription for now', '3rd November update = more issues! Now I swipe through 3 or 4 profiles and then it fails to load the next unless I close the app and reopen it! Add to that all the glitches with speed dating, the stupid \"as the crow flies\" problems I\\'m faced with and claims that in a 30-mile radius covering 4 counties (including London), there are under 10 guys on the app and Bumble is becoming pretty useless!', 'I had swiped right on a girl, and it forced me to swipe left. We matched, but since it forced me to swipe left, now I have to pay 9.99 for backtracking. No pro membership with infinite likes...nothing useful... i have to pay just to undo the error that Bumble forced onto me. A spotlight and backtracks are not worth a 9.99 subscription. Makes sense if it was a few matches back, but you should be able to undo your last swipe for free. The subscription by force is not an ethical business practice.', \"The premise is quite good. It's easy to use and the layout it very simple. However, I found that a large number of people who matched, who you messaged, would never reply. It became very pointless, very quickly. I also paid for a week's subscription, as the 250+ likes became intriguing. After they had gone, I had about 3 daily. Speed dating element is fun.\", \"Bad interaction design -- swipes aren't the best for smaller cards because when you scroll, there is a chance that it gets detected as a swipe when it wasn't intended to. Also not sure what's the point of blurring all profiles who swiped right on you; I get that it is meant to entice paid subscription, but all it does is turn me off cos how do I start evaluating? At least Hinge shows 1 profile while blurring the rest.\", \"Bumble has the gall to admit that it repeatedly shows you the same people you've already swiped on. There's no way to unmatch with a person that ghosted you without lying. There's no way to report certain kinds of fake users without lying. I'm physically attractive. I live in a major city, and jump between multiple hubs like it. I change my bio and add new pictures regularly. Still no matches. Still I use the app.\", \"The app is okay but the support team leaves a lot to be desired. I have had issues with my name being changed without my consent and for four months they have told me it would be corrected. I purchased a premium subscription they doesn't reflect in my account as well. The amount of errors makes me not want to ever come back to this app again. I paid 250 dollars for features I can't even use. Bumble portrays themselves like con artists with their lack of support for customers.\", \"Bumble has always been a nice concept for helping keep women from getting quite as overwhelmed with messages, but surprisingly it's worse than Tinder. I have identical profiles on Bumble and Tinder and am getting quite a bit more legitimate matches on Tinder. The only way to stand out and get matches/responses is to pay to send compliments, which defeats the purpose of women messaging first. Superlikes are a complete waste of money and time. It's like a Christian mingle app too.\", \"App sucks. I had about a dozen matches before getting premium, then absolutely NOTHING after paying, and NONE of my previous matches initiated any sort of conversation, so I couldn't talk to anyone. This app is always trying to sell super swipes or other features with absolutely no return. Also, the amount of fake accounts is staggering. Supermodel women (with no bio) are not on Bumble.\", 'I paid for 1week of Bumble Premium, but chose not to renew my subscription. I\\'ve purchased 1 week of it before & never had an issue seeing \"Likes.\" This time, after 2 days, the Likes died off & were nearly zero for the rest of the week. I didn\\'t think anything of it until I opened the app the morning my subscription ended, even less than 2 hours after it ended, to see \"200+\" under Likes. Bumble has refused to reply to my support msgs to explain why they were hidden while I paid. Waste of money.', 'DOWNLOAD ANY OTHER APP. Tried the app a few years ago, had a poor experience. Friend suggested I try it again, same deal. Paid for premium, getting matches wasn\\'t a problem. Problem is the concept. 9/10 matches will expire because they didn\\'t message first. Extending ends in the same result. If you do get a message, it will be \"hi\" or \"how was your weekend\" AKA messages women ignore on other apps bc they\\'re low effort. Also app is monetized in a predatory way. Sad and expensive waste of time.', \"This app is so over-rated. It's not empowering for women to always make the first move. As a woman, you should have a choice between making the first move and not. When women are in their magnetic power, they prefer to draw men in. And it actually becomes draining to chase a man. I think there should be a feature where you can choose to turn that on and off and shouldn't be the whole premise of the app. I think they've got it all wrong. I also got banned on there once for my preferences.\", \"Two stars are for the decent user base and the app itself isn't that bad, however... It is an absolute scam. Nearly every feature requires payment, and the price for premium exceeds any other app, and even then you don't get everything! It's basically $50 a month just to use the features that should be free. If you're on a budget, another app will be better.\", \"This app is virtually useless unless you pay the premium subscription. Both users need to do a positive swipe on each others to be allowed to match. Without premium, you can't see who is interested in you or be able to swipe on then specifically. I got someone interested in me, got notified about that, asked to buy premium to see who they were, didn't get them as a random suggestion in the short window of time in which I was allowed to reciprocate, which means back from square one.\", \"The user interface seems designed to make accidental super swipes, and it's frustrating that there's no way to undo these actions, especially when they limit the number of super swipes you get. The constant push to buy more super swipes or other premium features can be annoying, even if you've already paid for a subscription. It's disappointing when an app prioritizes upselling over user experience\", \"If I could rate this app zero stars I would. I purchased one week of Premium just to try it out and now I'm stuck with paying them every week. I've tried to find out where to go to unsubscribe because it doesn't show up on my Google Play subscriptions and I also unlinked my card information from my Bumble account but the charges still keep coming. I've contacted them twice about the issue and got ignored both times. Don't give them your card information. They will keep stealing your money.\", 'The app has stopped working. It has been almost 2 weeks now. If you open the app, it just keeps loading and searching without any results. I had opened a support ticket 10 days ago, but no one has reverted till now. I didnt have any trouble with the app and was patient, hoping it is a system glitch & will be resolved, but it is ongoing since 2 weeks which is quite annoying. From the reviews, i notice it is not me who is facing the challenge, so kindly requesting to you to check and resolve asap', \"DON'T get premium, it's a scam. You'll not see any better profiles. If you use travel mode it'll still show people outside the place you've chosen. If you use advanced filters you'll not see any results. So basically it's useless to get premium. And there's no option to contact support. Not recommended 👎\", \"Non existent support (submitted a support ticket 3 days ago for what should be a simple issue, haven't gotten a reply) and false advertising for paid memberships.. (unlimited back tracks are not unlimited) It works as an app but it's a pathetic attempt to separate people from their money as often as possible.. *11 days and counting, still nothing from support, just lip service here.. dropping to 1 star.. I paid for a month of premium at this rate it will expire before I get resolution..\", 'Bumble requires a photo of your ID and selfie to chat, but the app is so faulty it refuses to take my selfie and I\\'ve so many times. It keeps saying \"straighten up\". There\\'s no example of what the want and you can\\'t troubleshoot it because it\\'s not in the guideline. When I contacted them, they asked me if I\\'ve read the latest update. Problem is WHERE? The link provided sent me to 404 error page.', \"not as good as last year. I did some test on this app. try to pay for the unlimited swipe. so I swipe right on all of the ppl there. even tho There's so someone liked me n I keep on swiping right, most of all the time, the app didn't let u match with that person. I swipe right more than 30 ppl just to look for that one person that swiped right on me\", \"I enjoy a lot of aspects of this app, but I get burned out using it because there's not a filter to see only non-monogamous people. Also, I live near enough to the a major airport that so very many people showing in my stack are just passing through. A free filter to hide nonlocals would be greatly appreciated.\", 'Besides getting very few swipes per day on free -- and having left swipes reduce your right swipes -- it\\'s just a lousy app. Every match (few as they are) either times out without a message or is selling \"services\". And the app constantly upsells premium when, considering the standard, I have zero faith in it doing anything except taking my money', \"Used to be decent, but it's not nearly as good/enjoyable as it used to be. Not sure what's going on with matches, but for some reason every time I match with someone they don't show up on my matched with list. Ill chalk it up to maybe I was unmatched with and leave it at that but it's happening a bit too consistently to be a coincidence.\", \"Most of the people even after putting relationships still want to have conversation to keep casual I mean no one really wants to do real things now adays. People have conversations for 1-2 days and never talk. The profiles don't load up now it takes few minutes to see new profiles even though I keep refreshing or closing this app from recently ones but still it's slow the profiles don't show up it just keeps loading.\", 'I loved the \"compliments\" feature, shame it\\'s not free anymore. The new \"opener\" feature seems pointless, be as well just having free compliments on the other prompts again. Also, it would be great to hide \"travel mode\" profiles as I have no interest in these and lately 90% of profiles shown are these types of profiles. Can you change this new \"trending\" feature to be visible for premium members only seeing as it\\'s not available to the rest of us and therefore irrelevant.'], 'appId': 'com.bumble.app', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bumble.app&hl=en&gl=us'}\n"
