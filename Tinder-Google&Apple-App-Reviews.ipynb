Friends and coworkers suggested that I should get out there and that I’d gotten too comfortable being alone. This man was the only one to have normal conversation with me and so I had immediately gotten his Snapchat and phone number. Me being the nervous wreck I was started downing liquid courage and next thing I knew I was messaging him like a booty call……I ghosted him for 4 days after that night. When he messaged for a 3rd time I apologized from the bottom of my heart and let him know my over sharing and rushing into it scared me and he completely understood. Fast forward 8 months from there and I’m happier that ever. We’ve never had an argument not even in the slightest hand on the Bible. I’m so glad I gave love a chance again. I know even if this fails it was still both a blessing and a lesson. I don’t deserve the amazing man I was blessed with and he is nothing like anyone I’ve met. I hope I’ve found my someone and i hope the same for you. I was hesitant about online dating but now I’m so glad I did. Take the chance. It could be amazing❤️',\n",

It’s 12:30 at night and I’m about to go to bed and it wants me to sit here and send selfies of myself for verification to prove who I am. which I did and my account is still locked once again, this happened about two minutes after it took my $40. It’s a scam soon as I made the payment they locked my account. I can’t even get into the app now!! \\nUPDATE:  I just checked my banking account and they charged me over $70 and I’ve now permanently banned. All I did was set up my account and swipe through a few profiles and I’ve been permanently banned after they took over $70 from me this is a huge scam. There is no place to report it.

Instead of offering any help, or even looking into anything, I was sent back an email telling me there’s no point, and I’ll never be able to use tinder again using my Facebook or phone number (you can no longer sign up using just email). I can understand they are trying to keep their platform safe, but considering this could easily be proved if they just looked into the matter, but are in all honesty seemingly too lazy to do so. I was a premium member, it also doesn’t stop your membership. So despite my account being banned for an unknown amount of time, I have still been charged for the membership. They gave me no other notice that my account was banned or even under investigation other than when I tried to sign in again, so I have no way of knowing. When I brought that up to support they said it was my fault because “it’s stated on the bottom of the screen when you try to log back in” but again, I hadn’t tried signing in for a couple months, so with no other notice, I had no way of knowing I had to cancel the subscription.

I even went as far as to verify myself for tender, 2x. I randomly sign in when I to find that I am banned. The worst part is the girl that I have been talking to for the last week now has no contact information or way to get a hold of me. On top of that I have now been robbed the $40 due to being a tender platinum member because that’s how you get matches on the app. It’s 100% paid to play on tinder, and anyone who tells you otherwise, is a liar. The most painful part about this, is I want to meet a girl abroad, and now I am completely cut out of that. Thanks to tinder for taking all my money for the last year and a half, and never finding me matches that will respond. Even when I’m paying for the App. Ps trying to appeal with support is pointless. They will take their time responding, and that’s if they respond at all. The first time I messaged, I had someone tell me that my account was banned. Didn’t give me a reason and then immediately close the case so I could no longer message them.

Unfortunately, as time has passed the company has made taken away features and slowly asked for more money to unlock them; specifically with super likes. \\n     I’ve travelled alot and used tinder gold each time I travelled to find friends in new countries. Having five super likes a day helped me stand out from the crowd and led to fairly consistent matches. Even on a base account having access to the occasional super like was a huge help. \\n     Nowadays on a base tinder account you don’t have any super likes which is genuinely a huge detriment, and on tinder gold you get five a week. A massive decrease of 35 a week to 5. But the price remained the same???\\n     A super like was a fantastic way to differentiate yourself in an environment where first impressions are everything. And for some guys and gals who are great people but not super models it can help hedge your bets to match with people you have a genuine interest with. I think taking that tool to consistently show interest in people you genuinely like was a bad decision for the company.\\n     I use to be a fairly consistent subscriber for Tinder Gold and I used to speak highly of it too, but with these new changes I will never again give this company my money.',\n",

Btw, Hinge does that for free. Wanna leave a comment on someone’s picture? Surely you can do that with the Gold membership, right? Nope. Gotta shell out even more money for ~platinum~. Guess who also does it for free? You got it. Hinge (and I think OKC too). And even after emptying your wallet on one of their higher subscription tiers, you still only get one boost a week, and you’re still hounded with pop ups every 10 minutes to try out their creepiest feature - the super like. All of this on top of the inherent dating app negatives (ghosting, catfishing, creeps, excessive filters, etc) and you’re in for a miserable ride.

I did not violate your terms and conditions and I have no idea why you banned me. I’m gonna take it as a sign that I just shouldn’t be on Tinder but I mean still. Plus this app has no way to like fight the ban or even be reconsidered unless you are simply under review which is kinda dumb. I’m a real 21 yr old female, who is from American and currently lives in Italy for my job and I was literally on Tinder for a day but my phone service was not operating correctly so I tried deleting my account but it wouldn’t let me so I paused it. Then when my phone started to operate correctly again I tried to log back in to unpause my account and it said I was banned. None of my photos are copyright and there’s no way I could’ve gotten reported or anything when my phone was so messed up I couldn’t get any matches like it just kept putting the same people up over and over. Maybe you should ban the app instead of me. Whether it be my phone service or just your app bugging out, who knows but it definitely is not my fault.',\n",

They reply with a rude response so I report them and they’re unmatched. Today I go on to the app to discover I’ve somehow been banned. No reason given. The only connection I could think was the random glitch two days before or me reporting someone for rude behavior. Strangely enough my account still exists on my computer so I’m assuming this is another glitch. I have Tinder Platinum for another week so this makes the problem more annoying. Based on the recent reviews other people our getting banned. I hope this gets resolved or the app makes a statement.

I reached out to the company via email only to get the answer that they have no information on why I was banned and are unable to look into it.  A week later I was banned for the reason that Match owns Tinder and Hinge along with other apps. Hinge told me that Tinder would be able to provide me with information on why I was banned, when I reached out to them again I was replied with this. “Unfortunately even with no proof that you have violated the terms and policies we have in place, we cannot undo the process we have taken. We have no way to appeal banned accounts.

This is a common way to cut costs that is known to be easily exploitable by users. Men and women maliciously false report each other for rejection or not replying fast enough, leading to automated bans that cannot be contested. You can find videos of so-called “pickup artists” getting women banned after exchanging phone numbers so there will be less competition for her attention. I personally was banned after not replying to women for two weeks; several of them falsely reported me out of revenge and tinder support refuses to review the situation.  \\n\\nTinder’s male-to-female ratio is notoriously poor, in some regions being as bad as 9-to-1 according to one study. This leads to unhappiness for everyone, as women are spammed and men are ignored. To give the impression of there being more women, tinder ignores your search preferences and shows you women far outside of your age and geographic ranges. I do not want to date 18 year olds, they cannot hold a conversation. If you want to see women no less than X years old, you must set your minimum age to X+3 in my experience.

They don’t do any background checks on the people who join to make sure they are human. Secondly they spam it with advertisements and every 7th person you swipe on is an ad. Thirdly the amount of times it tells you, “you need to upgrade to get women to match with you” is incredibly annoying. Fourth, if you swipe right on everyone on the app Tinder actually throttles how many people you can match with. The first day I ran a test and swiped on every girl, I managed to go through about 40 women before it said I’m out of swipes. Next day I do it and get about 20. Now when I load the app I swipe on about 4 women before I have to upgrade my account because Ive ran out of swipes. It’s very unfair and flawed. Lastly they have these stupid “swipe surges” and other random events that “guarantee you’ll\\nmatch with someone.” Ive gone to about 4 of these events (and by go I mean had the app open) and haven’t matched with anyone, and yes I know it’s all about appearances, and I wouldn’t say I’m ugly nor attractive but still. This app is a huge scam, waste of time, try something like Bumble or Facebook Dating. 1000% better than this trash app.',\n",

Recently, I had re-signed up for tinder after deleting the app from a few months ago. When I downloaded the app I bought tinders gold feature. After a week or so of using the app I was prompted to get photo verified and I submitted my picture then. After waiting an entire day of not being able to access the app because my photo was still under review I sent their customer support an email message about the issue. Later the same day, i still had received no response back but was able to again access the app. A day later I was prompted that my account was banned. Between getting photo verified and being banned I messaged zero people and before that I had not in weeks if at all after my initial download of the app. I tried to reach out to their customer service via phone and I received busy signals, I reached out again using email and have not gotten a response. This was an extremely frustrating situation that do not completely understand myself but I have moved on from it. This review is to state my experience so that viewers are aware of the risk they take by just using the app.',\n",

I’ve had the app on and off over several years, and it used to function fine and give off the impression of being fair in presenting potential matches. In the past couple years they have somehow taken a perfectly decent app and ruined it. The app is very clearly now about maximizing profit at the expense of the user. This is made abundantly clear by shoving paid features down our throats and showing higher quantities of higher liked users only to paying members. Meanwhile non-paid members are left with a limited experience and fewer matches. The decision makers at Tinder are insulting the user’s intelligence by thinking we won’t notice it. The users notice this and are vacating the app. The user base is clearly not as alive as it used to be and I’m sure Tinder sees declining numbers in there regular user count reports. And after putting up with all of this, they have the nerve to randomly ban and delete my account, with zero warning or explanation, thus deleting all conversations I had going. If any other app developers want an example of how to take a decent app and run it into the ground, look not further than Tinder.',\n",

It’s not as if there were any cute girls that wanted to talk to me anyway. Dating apps in general are a joke compared to meeting people in person, but Tinder takes the cake for the very worst right after MeetMe. I guess I’m either too pretty for dating apps, or Tinder (an app for adults I thought? And I was not explicit by any means!) hasn’t been clear enough on what isn’t allowed in bios. Regardless, Tinder lost someone that the vast majority of people would swipe right on, and I lost access to an app that did nothing positive for me, and left MUCH to be desired. I guess I should go to clubs where they only let in women that are too good looking to be real so I can fit in and not be seen as fake, and meet girls as cute as me. But this app was NO GOOD.

On that note, I have travelled to South American countries, the app still somewhat much better there than in the NYC tri-state area. I wouldn’t recommend the app unless you’re going to smaller cities (ironically) or abroad, it seems to still work. Maybe people (or men) in…London experience the same issue with fake profiles, advertising social media to buy their access or out of place matches.

Every time I try and type a message to someone, my typing lags and then whatever I wrote will randomly pop up 5-10 seconds later. Every time I get a message notification, Tinder won’t show it to me and I have to literally delete the app and redownload it in order to read what someone said to me. It’s like every time I try to use this app, something glitches and it makes my experience horrible. I was able to handle the overwhelming lagginess for a while, but now that I can’t even read a message without having to delete and redownload feels completely unacceptable from an app this widely used. And it isn’t an issue with my phone since I got a new one recently and it’s STILL happening. I think I’ve finally hit my breaking point with this app, I had a great few years but I don’t think I will be going back until it gets patched and works like a 2021 app instead of a flash website from 2005.',\n",

It makes trying to have a continuous conversation very hard. On top of that, a recent update with the option to allow video calls has made conversation hard. After a couple back and forth messages, a pop up will appear at the bottom of the screen, covering about 1/3 of the screen. It asks if you are fine with video calls with that specific person. I like that it seeks consent. The only way to get rid of the giant pop up is agreeing or disagreeing. When you open the keyboard with the pop up still there, it just moves up, covering your conversation. I used to like the app. But in the past year or so, it has gone downhill.

I understand that people can be predatory but the practices that Tinder is doing is awful. They are banning people for no reason. In my case I got banned for nothing because the worst message I sent was “hey cutie”. My roommate got banned even though he didn’t message ANYONE. When I went online I saw that this problem was prolific and everywhere. They ban people for absolutely no reason and without any proof. If they receive one report, you’re done. So theoretically, a guy, who doesn’t have a good chance with the ladies, can lower the dating pool by making a fake account and reporting any dude they find to be more attractive than them. And when you try to email tinder about the situation, you get an automated reply and ZERO help at all. The email they sent me said “we do not check for what you did and we do not unban or review accounts.” This type of practice from Tinder is illogical and sexist. And it will eventually lead to the demise of this app. I cannot wait to see this app be removed from the App Store.',\n",

I submitted an appeal asking what I had done and received a generic email that had spelling errors in response. Incredibly unprofessional for a major corporation.

I still talk to a good amount of people from tinder using snap and ended up dating one of them so it wasn’t a total loss, but I still won’t be able to make an account ever again.

I would rather use a glitchy buggy app with real people providing high quality support than a nice smooth friendly GUI app that has no support.

This added insult to injury, and I couldn't help but feel that my concerns were being dismissed. All in all, this dating app's poor user experience, deceptive charges, and questionable connections left me thoroughly dissatisfied and wary of online dating platforms. In a baffling twist, some of the connections I encountered on this dating app seemed to originate from a call center. I could clearly understand the language they were speaking, which only added to the suspicion that something was amiss.

My entire Tinder experience (which has been on and off for YEARS) is absolute trash - the people on here included. Constant gross messages, ghosting, fakes, and just flat out terrible people. But then again, thats every other dating site so it isn't really Tinder’s fault. I just wish they’d allow people to separate based on what they’re looking for.

First of all, cell phones don’t have static because they’re not analog TVs, so the glitching effect makes no sense. All the ambulances you see are from the 1970s because that’s all they had access to I guess. The sets are tiny and empty, I guess because the portrait aspect ratio doesn’t allow you to see much of the environment, so maybe that’s actually good filmmaking then. Obviously the acting is terrible and they try way to hard to make people sound “hip” and cool. Maybe they based the dialog on all y’all’s chat logs and some of you really talk like that. It’s really ironic that the app won’t let me click anything but the Swipe Night video plays fine.

But, as time as went on, all men on there just want hookups, when I decline them of sexual favors, they must of report me, always. Because now I’m banned for absolutely no reasoning behind why. I never once talked in a sexual manner to any male on there, if anything that kind of conversation happend on another social media platform. I’ve read so many reviews of people getting banned for no reason. This is absolutely insane and ridiculous how you can just get rid of users left and right without any explanation behind it. All my ex boyfriends are from tinder, I use to use it every day when I was single. Why ban me for something I have not done. Prices on tinder gold and etc, are outrageous. I can’t stand dating apps anymore. Please tinder, if you are going to band 75% of your users, give us reasoning behind why. i’m now 22 and wanting to explore the dating world but yet being banned for no reason has become the issue.',\n",

In my first week I’d have easily over a hundred matches and countless conversations with some pretty cool people. I made lots of new connections whether online or in person. But idk what’s happened over the last year or so. After the last couple times I’ve downloaded, I get almost no matches. It will say I have 100+ people who swiped on me but will literally get no more than 2-3 matches a week. My messages don’t go through, and matches randomly disappear during a good conversation. It’s extremely frustrating and the app is definitely playing people. Even the secret admirer function tells me to pick one of 4 cards that swiped on me... but when I pick one it says better luck next time. Every single time... there’s so many better apps out there that don’t do this. One starts with a B and another with an H. I’d highly suggest trying those out and deleting this useless app. This review would get one star except for the fact that tinder used to be good and I would’ve gave it 4-5 stars a couple years ago.',\n",

Almost every other time you tap through someones profile you get a large pop up prompt asking you to super like them, which always blocks out location information. Same with liking popular users. In my opinion, a premium paying user shouldn’t be constantly inundated with pop ups trying to siphon more money out of them.\\nThere’s also issues with matching/chat functionality. Likes and messages are regularly dropped, which leads to situations where you think somebody is ignoring you but they just never even got your message. I’ve had a couple chats just get deleted wholesale as well.\\nFor the amount of money this app takes in, it should be much more polished and reliable.\\nThat being said I’ve gotten a couple decent hookups over the past month so I can’t completely hate it.

I didn’t post anything even remotely controversial, offensive or risky. They banned me for no reason. If you are looking for a dating site, go somewhere else- This one is not worth it. The people who work for tinder are all robots who have no sense of community. They are sheep. The bans completely lack evidence and are random. Tinder steals your information and then blocks you from accessing your account. Tinder used to be a fun way to connect with people. It’s a complete joke. I’m not even sure the people i received support emails from are real people. The messages seemed very automated and fake. The prices are also outrages. Unless you pay out the Wazoo for likes you will not have fun on this app. I think it’s time to abandon online dating and meet people the traditional way. Tinder is the absolute worst.',\n",

Once I did and saw my likes, I started matching right away with most of them. However, after a few dozen matches (almost 50) a day later, all of a sudden no more likes, AT ALL, so no one to match with. Instead, it now bombards me with pop ups to buy Super Boost to get more exposure. Otherwise, no more likes for me. I got Tinder Gold for a month, but it was only really worth two days.

I’m not trying to hookup left and right with these women you feel me?\\n\\n•Scan a valid License in order to create an account\\nThis would: 1. Keep bots from flooding the tinder space, 2. Ensure people are their correct age and not lying,\\nAnd 3. Make it a safer space for all included easier way to verify',\n",

However, there are certain things the app does that greatly decrease the quality of the experience. For one, recently, I have found that I cannot open profiles till I match with the person. This means I cannot read the majority of the information. After researching, I learned that this is part of beta testing for a possible future feature. I’d like to firmly say that I absolutely hate this. Also, I often find that the app ignores my preferences, showing me the profiles of literal teenagers. Why have an age filter if the algorithm will ignore it? I also find that often I become matched with people I am sure I never swiped right on. Many of my friends have also experienced this. I also wonder if tinder ever matches me with people who didn’t swipe right on me. In general, why offer features that the app itself than makes obsolete? Make it make sense.',\n",

They won’t let you filter by ethnicity, you can’t filter out transgendered “women”, they only offer tags like BLM,  LBGQ, Pronouns, Vaccinated, etc - they offer only liberal categories for everything. Dating apps, social media platforms and news media outlets are all hyper focused on transforming our society and our country into a giant pile of crap.

I’ve met many cool people from the app but I’ve also met my fair share of crazy people from the app. I found that the more people I matched with (and didn’t communicate with) the more likely my account was to be banned. That happened three times, but this last time I actually deactivated my account because I met someone. When that didn’t work out, I returned to the app only to be met with an explanation that my account had been banned citing that I had violated Tinder’s Terms and Conditions. How could it have been banned when it hadn’t even been active? I pointed this out to Tinder support but received an email that they don’t have an appeals process, which is unfortunate. I’m inclined to believe that they don’t actually review reports on accounts to see if they’ve actually violated Terms and Conditions but they instead just go ahead and ban accounts. The integrity of this app is greatly compromised. I would not recommend Tinder to friends.',\n",

Some times if I get an actual notification and check that after the phantom notification disappears but only for a few hours until it returns again.

       "  'review': 'I was using this app last year for the first time. Under the impression that it was free, I thought it would be worth a try. After a few days, it said I had to upgrade to premium to match with any more profiles. I should have deleted the app right there and saved a lot of trouble, but I didn’t. After doing a one month trial the app said I can save money by doing a 6 month plan which I did, since it was taking me a while to get any luck. Shortly after that, I got banned from the app permanently for no reason. I looked up what could have happened but nothing applied to me. I only messaged the people I matched and was always respectful. When I looked for customer service there was no number, so I sent a nice email detailing my problem but never heard back. I still had to pay for this app until June. Warning to anyone thinking of using Tinder DON’T! There are many places you can meet nice women or men in the real world which are much cheaper and more fun than any dating app.',\n",

In a city 5X that size, I’m lucky if I get a dozen a month while paying for the ridiculously priced platinum package.\\n\\nI’d say use Hinge or some other competitor, but the bad news is that they’re all owned by the same company.

So my face ends up at the bottom of the screen (covered by my profile info), whenever I preview it. Also, when I upload a video and preview it, the video just doesn’t play at all. I don’t know if this is an issue specifically with the editing portion, and I’m just seeing the preview that way even though nobody else is, OR if everyone’s seeing it that way, too. That’s really the only problem I have, but it definitely makes it hard to add photos and videos to my profile.',\n",

It claims to give 5 new super likes a week and one boost a month BUT they don’t compound (use em or lose em). This is a scam considering super likes don’t really add up to anything. Many times, you get shown a profile that has been inactive for months and Tinder goes on to prompt you to use your super likes (mind game manipulation) because the person’s profile is “popular” and you’ll get a better chance to match (matching is meaningless) I doubt the legitimacy of what Tinder is proposing and think they just want you to burn your super likes so you buy more. Also, many use the app to re direct you to other apps (snap/instagram thirst traps/scams) or onlyfans 🙄\\n\\nImprovements: increase standards for entry. Only verified accounts. Make reporting scammers/fakes/bait easier. Fix bugs. Stop with the manipulative prompts. Transparency. Compound superlikes and boosts. Allow to delete old matches we didn’t message.

After the coup took place in Myanmar I felt compelled to do something, so I changed my location to Myanmar and offered in my bio to help protesters with sharing videos and organizing. After a few days my account was banned for- who knows what but I received nothing but gratitude and appreciation from my matches. It is infuriating that I could be banned for doing one of the most humane things I’ve ever done. I can understand the circumstances that would lead to an accidental ban, maybe they marked me as spam or something, but the fact that I am now banned for life without any possibility of review (you have no ban appeal) makes me want to take this to a news outlet. I know tinder got in trouble for banning BLM protesters and I don’t see how this is any different.

There making a huge profit from men such as myself. I was wrong about the concept being a combination of dating and sex, ITS JUST SEX!!! If you are actually trying to date someone on this app, any female will think of you as a fool and laugh about it. I lost the game the moment I made the offer of taking a woman on a date with me.

Its the most effective dating and hookup app when it works. Its really sad that its so problematic now, and resolutions only happen up to a week after contacting support. Make sure if you match you give out your cell number IMMEDIATELY, as there is a high likelihood your match will disappear along with everyone else 🥺. (And no, the standard fixes dont work and its not being unmatched, Ive checked) Good luck!',\n",

Those who can manipulate and adapt to the visual storytelling of the profile get hundreds if not thousands of matches, and those who can also put cute and cheeky energy into the first message and throughout the conversation can have as many partners as they want.\\nAnd therein lies the problem.\\nYou can always have more. There is no limit to the number of men or women you can have if you know how to attract them. So when a relationship has a problem, you can just end it and move onto the next one.\\nThis is very damaging for those who are looking to settle down, because they struggle keeping a partner who has multiple other girls/guys lined up.\\nOr they have to settle for someone who seems unattractive compared to all the other guys/girls theyve matched with before.\\nWe get our ego stroked here.

This makes me honestly think any profiles *I* liked never saw my profile. I might be unlucky, ugly, or whatever, but I would be willing to bet that Tinder suppresses or hides my likes. In general I'd say half the profiles are fakes, and again I'm also willing to bet that they won't do anything about the fakes because they need them since they've made the algorithm so that it suppresses engagement. Just don't bother. SCAM.\",\n",

That’s not necessarily what I want out of this experience with Tangier but it’s been nothing but tumbleweed blowing by. \\nThe first thing I’m not satisfied with is that I am a 59-year-old man and most of my respondents have been, frankly, overweight, late 60s, geriatrics.\\nI am a very active human and that’s just not the way I roll.\\nI joined Tinder to meet people. Maybe, for a date that turns into a friendship – or maybe a hook up that ends with nothing, or even further still a pleasant day that turns into a lifelong relationship. I am just simply trying to put myself out there.\\nInstead, I get a constant asking for more money to boost my profile with the same results once I gave into the pressure to do so.\\nI am still hopeful to make a connection with someone, but if the history of the last several weeks, being on the app is any indication, that’s slight at best, and I can be optimistic at a fault. Anyway, you asked for review and you just got it. All the best to all the people that seem to have their phone blowing up and hooking up every night.

I was a longtime user of about 4 to 5 years that very randomly got banned from the app.  No explanation or justification as to why, and was not given any type of opportunity to address or redeem the issue.  When I inquired, I was given a very broad and boiler plate type of response from Tinder that was clearly copy and paste that completely avoided my inquiry for a potential refund. Yea, refund, as I had just renewed my subscription for a month less than 24 hours from when this happened.\\n\\nThis is how people date nowadays.  Tinder’s staff is swift to judge and alienate without reasoning, and it effects all profiles you have, or may have in the future, across all “Match Group” platforms.

This app is designed for gratification or base impulses, and it does a really poor job at helping you satisfy your desires if you’re a real, genuine human who is above social influences. Matches I’ve made are generally short lived, without conversation or engagement with any women I’ve matched with. To me, that reflects the shallow purpose of this app: “getting laid”. If you’re intellectual, struggle with emotions, or want something meaningful, avoid Tinder because it’s not meant for you. Most profiles are fake. I’d personally destroy this application if I could because I’ve been chronically rejected by almost every match I’ve made and it’s not my fault.

For my money, Id rather use Bumble or even Facebooks new, free dating service, and overall get a better result without spending over $40 per month.  Sorry tinder.',\n",

The ad revenue isn’t enough for them and my friends that have been successful on the app after it became a cash grab paid for boosts (they lied about it ofc, but I caught them in their lie). I used to have pretty good luck on here back when Tinder was relatively new, but now it’s just a waste of time and after the first day of being a free member it’s clear no one sees my profile (I’ll rack up likes the first day, then suddenly nothing). It’s obvious why it works this way and resetting your account doesn’t cut it anymore. Tinder also has next to zero respect for GDPR and won’t disclose all of the information they keep on you (Google it). I wouldn’t be surprised if they are doing shady things with your information (which includes their method of sabotaging the effectiveness of a profile reset).',\n",

From regularly reminding you to use your super likes (free users only get one per day) to withholding matches (they will tell you “match with ____ when you buy tinder gold” but will not display that profile in the stack) it creates a poor user experience. \\n\\nI could complain about bots, prostitutes, ads, or scams but that’s all common knowledge with this app. \\n\\nThey will regularly insert advertisements into you matches without prior warning. I have even gotten “new match” notifications only to find that my “new match” is an ad for something I do not care about in the slightest. I have no issue with ads being placed in the stack but I do not want to be told I have a match and get all excited only to find “smile direct club”.\\n\\nThe final issue with this app isn’t even with the app itself. The culture it has allowed to exist in the app is one of “gaining a small ego boost” from a match rather than actually meeting up. I have met up with people from bumble and other apps before but it seems like most people on tinder have little interest in using this dating app for dating. \\n\\nTwo stars because it’s a good concept but since Facebook bought them the app has been awful.',\n",

Guess what? my phone number had been banned completely. for reasons unknown to me. So apparently Tinder can’t unban my account or my phone number. So the only possible way I could use tinder again. Is if I get a new phone number. Like thanks. It’s crazy how if someone reports me. Even if the reason is bogus I’ll get banned. It’s even crazier how I can’t get my account back. It’s even crazier how they banned my phone number. ITS EVEN CRAZIER THAN ILL HAVE TO GET A NEW PHONE NUMBER JUST TO USE TINDER. thanks.',\n",

Now, I actually had screenshots of my profile because my best friend was curious about what was on mine and vice versa. I emailed this to support and was basically told what everyone else on here was, that they don’t review or unban. It’s unfortunate that they will unnecessarily lose so many customers to their competitors in this way. Good news is, been having much better luck with matches and some really great new friends with those competitors (B/H), and their prices for premium options are much more affordable. So although I’m rating this a one star for the ridiculous customer service, it’s actually been quite the favor to me. Thanks for the ban tinder. 🤣',\n",

This app needs more valid reasons why a person was banned! Do better in customer service! Do better at investigating how a person should be banned! Do better!!!!!!!!!',\n",

It will expose you to transphobes and people who break the ToS without a second thought, all while hammering down over the slightest thing if you identify as anything outside the man/woman binary.  My own account was banned without any real context or explanation for what I had done.  Nothing was being solicited and I wasn’t showing nudity.

I have friends who are definitely attractive and had the same issues. This app is nothing but a scam preying on lonely people, unless you look like a supermodel you will barely get any matches. Also, when you do get a match, it’s probably a robot or a girl selling her onyfans.

It seems to me that Tinder doesn’t actually review any reports because I scoured my profile and messages for anything against the terms & conditions and concluded that it must have been someone (or several people) who were upset for personal reasons and reported me, and Tinder took them as legitimate reports. Highly disappointed with the lack of help and information I’ve received and glad I’m not wasting money on them anymore',\n",

A super boost used to be $19, now it’s $59. It’s sick that tinder is price gouging their customers to such an extreme level. And forget about meeting anybody without paying any money, those days are gone. Also, scammers abound. You’ll see plenty of fake profiles from 8k miles away, unrealistically hot women, and women just looking for IG and SC followers. At this point there are several less expensive apps with way less scammers that are more effective for finding what you want (Bumble, Hinge, Feeld). Save your sliding thumb for something that won’t ruin your budget. Tinder should be ashamed of themselves.',\n",

I had done nothing wrong and wasn’t really even being active on the app at this point but for some reason was permanently banned for violating terms? Complete scam and waste of my money and was still charged. I emailed support and they were no help to the issue either and eventually just stopped emailing back. ridiculous customer service and do not pay for any sort of subscription or you will be locked.',\n",

And of course the same company that owns tinder owns several other popular dating apps so they make sure to ban you from all of them.  Horrible experience!

I do remember from 4 years ago I had random guys adding me on Snapchat. One of them told me that someone was pretending to be me and giving out my personal information. They were pretending to be me but not with my pictures, with someone else’s. Supposedly it was revenge because I dated a guy that they wanted to be with (which I actually never did they had me confused with my ex best friend). So if I could get my tinder account unbanned and checked that would be great because I’m just trying to meet someone or people I’m not trying to do anything “inappropriate”. Thank you',\n",

It didnt make sense especially since I had the app deleted for the longest time, and wasn’t matched or taking to anyone. My photos where verified and my bio was tasteful and appropriate. I still have a hard time figuring out what terms I “violated”. The worst part is that they give you no explanation, nor a single email to speak with someone regarding what happened.

Feeld does not do this to people. Also, they sell you boosts and put the button to start them right next to the home button so you accidentally press it on purpose, wasting a lot of money. They give you no way to cancel it, request a refund, or get any kind of technical support. Tinder has a thousand ways to rip you off.\", 'Tinder\\'s response is pointless. My problem is not addressed in troubleshooting. I have found no way to communicate, as my email sends to have been ignored. With a platinum membership I\\'m supposed to be able to message \"super likes\", but 2 I\\'ve sent through the \"verified\" selections have not given me the option of messaging. Customer service is impossible to reach. All I\\'ve found are broken links and I\\'ve been given the runaround everywhere I\\'ve tried.', \"I feel like this app has gotten significantly worse over the years. When I first started using the app, it was full of bots and now, it's still full of bots, breaks features (like Spotify integration) constantly, and finds the need to monetize EVERY LITTLE THING. Good luck trying to get one singular person from their support team to help with anything because they'll just swap with somebody else every hour until they just give up and close the ticket. Tinder, fix your buggy, bot-infested app.\", \"Whatever you do, don't turn off your auto renew on your subscription until just before your subscription ends. I turned it off right after Tinder charged me, and instead of letting me finish the week that I paid for, they just took my subscription away completely but still charged me. The price for a subscription doubled when I went to go buy it again. It's absolutely ridiculous that it's impossible to get a refund because you can't talk to anyone. Tinder just leads you in circles. 😠\", \"Absolute waste of time. Honestly, it's probably worse than just wasted time. There is a place for online dating, but this app puts a massive pay wall at every turn. Even setting that aside, it is still full of either fake profiles and/or girls that just want an ego boost. Men on this app have a better chance of getting hit by lightning than actually getting a good match. You would be at least 10x more likely to find someone to date at church or the bar. Also women need to step up the bio game\", \"Really sucks when the app itself seems like it's trying to prevent any conversations from happening. Like for example when you have a match that you're talking to completely disappear (assuming she unmatched) but when you reload the app a week later it turns out you have an unopened message from them that never showed up before. Really annoying, very buggy app, fix it\", \"This app has been the genesis for some really important relationships in my life, but DAMN it's so annoying to use. I have to log back in (with forced 2FA) basically every time I open the app, sometimes it will freeze every time I click the settings icon/change my age range or distance settings, and sometimes it works fine! The aggressive dark-patterns and pushes to purchase premium are scummy too. Just go to concerts and bars instead, you're more likely to actually talk to people.\", 'No matches unless you upgrade. Then you\\'re getting secret admirers that you already received before. So you\\'re basically paying for the same thing, over and over. Also, you have to remove your payment method when you sign up for the upgrades because if you simply \"cancel\" the upgrade with how the app functions right now, it won\\'t work and you\\'re going to be getting charged, as I have just found out. Absolute trash.', \"Constant popups that get in the way of app operation makes the UX feel annoying and stuttery. Like the undismissable floating bubble for super likes which blocks all view of bio and info when swiping. Many of the popups are for super likes, which I imagine is an extremely rare use case for most. Also there are no options to disable 'reminder' notifications. And the functionality for sorting when dragging/arranging photos on your profile is not good.\", \"9/8/22 I get notified that I have a new match and when I go to click on it, it's no longer there. This has happened when I go to message a match too. This has happened in the past and the matches will reappear randomly but so far they haven't. All my current matches are mixed up and the most recent conversation isn't even on the top. Fix your app. I've been using tinder for years and this is the worst I've seen it malfunction. 10/18/23 same issues are still occurring\", 'The app is a buggy, awful mess and the support agents are incompetent (coming from somebody who has years of experience in product support). I upgraded to Tinder Gold, but am unable to access any of the paid features in the app because of a bug, and somehow according to Support the issue is unfixable and there is no way to refund me. Absolutely unacceptable. I will be following up as many times as needed to get the service that I paid for OR a full refund and will be accepting no less.', 'App doesn\\'t work. No customer support. The Guide page is useless. Same profile show up in the stack. I can view profiles in the stack but app crashes when I attempt to view a match\\'s profile. Unable to get new matches. Keep getting the \"failed to match error\". No incoming messages but I get text message replies when I send my phone # to matches. I have tried everything in the troubleshooting guide. Upgraded my phone from Galaxy A4 to S23 Ultra and still nothing. Does not work on web browser.', \"This app is a hit or miss as it is with all the Bitcoin scammers, but the notifications system is broken and has been for over 5 months. Sometimes I get the notifications for matches and after I restart the app is when the matches would show up. But after that messaging feels like a game of tag because the notifications won't work after someone responds. I have potentially missed on matches because of this. I am paying for premium but getting a subpar experience. Make it free if you can't fix.\", \"The app fails to function properly. I get solid matches and have good convos and then all of a sudden my discovery is the same girls every time, (even if I swipe left or right) I can't view my match's profiles anymore, (Not just one, all of them) and I can't even delete my account because it errors out! I've been using Tinder on and off for years and only now am I suddenly experiencing these issues. I even created a new account and the issues are back already. I'd rather pay for Bumble\", 'It\\'s good for getting dates, but the app itself is awful on Android. It\\'s very buggy and glitchy, and I get stuck in weird prompt loops at times and have to restart it to get out. The filter options do not actually work most of the time, and it shows me people outside of my age and distance ranges, even when there are girls who arent. There is also no option to remove stickers on your account, so I have a \"happy pride month\" sticker on my card in August, which just makes me look like a dummy!', 'Don\\'t pay for it. It\\'s a cool app, but there is a glitch with the premium features under Likes You. If you add any filter to the Likes, it restricts you to 20 results, rather than letting you scroll through all the filtered Likes. This is only an issue on the app as of the recent week or two. I submitted a support ticket, provided a recording showing the issue and was told, \"Unfortunately, this is all the support we’re able to offer at this moment. We appreciate your time and understanding.\"', \"The functionality is basically gone. Swipes won't register, and once you swipe the first time, it shows you're out of swipes and keeps cycling through the same people but won't tell you that nothing is actually happening. I can message my old matches, but cannot view their profile and pics, any attempt will boot you out of the app. Changing distance and age range also has no effect, and changes won't save anyway. The constant ad profiles are garbage too, but at least that much is intentional.\", 'I used to be able to easily remove myself from the stack. Now the setting to enable or disable the discovery feature is hidden and it tries to get you to pay for a premium feature instead of just turning off discovery. On top of that the setting has never changed for me no matter how many times I have gone into settings and turned off enable discovery. Being able to turn off tinder without deleting my profile was important to me. Will be looking at other apps.', \"The location is extremely lacking on profiles. I have to use a map app to ensure profiles are actually in the state as I've had several searches day a city and that they're 10-20 miles away and they are in another state! Sometimes across the country! It would help if they put not only city, but also state in the location. The distance can also be fixed for better accuracy.\", 'Customer support is horrible. Constantly just copy and pasting the same thing over and over. Not actually communicating. No phone number for support either. I would buy the standard boosts and I would get prime time boosts instead. Also charged for them as well. They would run automatically while I was traveling. What a scam. Also unable to get verified. The new AI verification simply does not work no matter what I would do with lighting or anything else in their FAQs and CS responses.', 'Designed to waste money, customer support is trained to be unhelpful. \"SUPERLIKES\" are something you pay for. The app is designed to constantly shoot up a big pop up bubble to remind you to use it. If you accidentally touch that bubble, it automatically uses a superlike. You are supposed to get it back if you are a subscriber and \"undo\" the like immediately, but you do not. Support refuses to help. Tinder is a scam designed to bleed you for money.', 'Piece of junk. It seems impossible to get even a single match. After going through the stack once, any new entries are junk. No profile. Can\\'t see face. Cynical. Not so much a problem with the app, but it\\'s a miserable experience. User profiles are bare bones. There\\'s a list of \"Passions\" that you can choose from, that really don\\'t make sense. You can select \"Atari\" but not \"Video games.\" You can\\'t write in your own. There\\'s minimal selection for who you\\'re interested in. Man/Woman, age range.', 'Have had a lot of the \"your account has been banned\" notification. Even though I\\'ve done nothing wrong and after uninstalling the app for a while it usually fixes it. But it\\'s very frustrating not having access to my account. Customer service even said they see nothing wrong with y account on their end. But it shows it on multiple devices for me. Idk but it\\'s VERY irritating.', \"This app could be good, and is under certain circumstances, but once you've messed up your algorithm no one will ever see you and you'll just be cursed to swiping endlessly on people that will never see your card on their stack. Also the premium features are nice but the price has increased exponentially to a point where I don't think I'd ever be able to financially justify even the lowest tier. Like a lot of apps, Tinder has only gotten worse and worse as time goes on.\", \"Every time I open the app since downloading several days ago, I'm met with a screen to verify my profile with photos. When I go to take the photos, the buttons don't work meaning I can't actually verify my account. I can't use the app at all, not even to delete my profile. Support has been giving canned responses which don't actually address the issue. Kind of a bummer.\", \"Well I been trying about a month pretty much each day. The reason is this app isn't letting me click on the profile with the person I am chatting with, to see their profile and distance. Messages aren't going out or coming in. I had Tinder for many years! Didn't ever have a problem like this. I uninstalled and reinstalled Tinder about a dozen times! Still same problems. Not getting new matches and I travel alot so my location is always in new areas. Very disappointed. Tinder fix this 😠 😡 😤 !\", \"The app does next to nothing about the constant stream of fake accounts, likely because this gives you a seemingly high number of anonymous likes, which pressures you into buying premium to see them. (Which I've had from the start) For example, every day or so I would get a new like, from a new account, exactly 30 miles away. Dozens of these. The app isn't designed to find you matches. Its designed to string you along for as long as possible to keep you paying for it.\", 'Practically unusable - gets stuck on \"Finding people near you\" and other tabs don\\'t load content either. The content does eventually load bit by bit, taking multiple minutes for each tab. Images then take even more time to load in, sometimes never actually loading. Other apps don\\'t have the same issue and speed tests don\\'t show any issues. Edit: no way to undo an accidental swipe without paying. Overall frustrating experience.', \"I used Tinder off and on for a few years now and I tried their subscriptions. The UI is a lot better than most dating apps. And at first I got a decent ammount of matches. The past 2 years I almost never get matches in my homw town, common places I visit, or areas I commute to. I've updated profile pictures, changed my bio, and adjusted my preferences multiple times but nothing changes. Why would I continute to pay for the extras you get with Plus and Gold if it barely produces any results?\", 'Pretty good as far as meeting people goes; if you have decent photographs of yourself. I dropped two stars for the internal Ad system. I paid for the top plan in hopes of avoiding Ads, but to no avail. The app is riddled with internal ads. I never know if any button I tap will be for a feature I have, or a request for more money. Probably not worth paying for more than the lowest plan.', \"I had a billing question, and their customer service team was quick to respond but never actually answered my question. It was like talking to a really bad AI. Also, they nearly doubled pricing in the last year, at a time when everyone is moving to other apps. I've been paying for this app for years, but I'm getting better dates from Hinge and Bumble recently, and between that, the egregious 80% price hike, and the poor customer support, I'm not going to pay anymore.\", \"I don't know why it is so popular. Same money draining app like others. When you upgrade, you will be swapping pictures of dead profiles or fake ones. Very limited filter option reduced to age and distance. Still using it. Sometimes suggesting profiles from the other part of the globe even if distance limits are applied. Still no option to filter inactive profiles and there is plenty od them. Really annoying.\", \"Tired of getting nonsense notifications. Tried to disable the ones that aren't relevant to me, and was pleasantly surprised to see there were options to do so. I was immediately UNpleasantly surprised to find that when I tried to disable anything, it would kick me to my devices notification settings. Upon returning to the app, anything that I had disabled before being kicked had re-enabled itself. If this is a mistake, that's pretty pathetic. If it's not, that's just shady as hell. I'm out.\", \"Somehow, this app went from being somewhat decent to just being a pile of trash, which has had me cancel my Gold membership as of now. - There are parts that are either too specific or not specific enough. - Discovery Queue gives you NOTHING related to what you're looking for. - Top Picks show you profiles completely unrelated to your selection and usually consist of blank, instantly put-together profiles. - Filters don't work at all. You end up paying more and more for worse and worse.\", \"access to others is locked behind microtransactions that really just open up more microtransactions. except they're not so micro. This app has so many blinking lights, pop up dialogues, and requests to do things that you don't care about that it's really just layers of banner ads on top of each other with very little functionality.\", \"Half of all profiles are fake! Tinder doesn't do anything about them either. Some obvious fakes a even have verifications from them. Also makes everyone's photos look so smoothed out and takes quality and details out of them. Also incredibly basic when uploading your profile photos, there's no option to view albums on your device, only to see latest photos. Terrible app\", \"The worst app I've ever used, no exaggeration. Many times profile pics do not load. It's slow. Outdated. Embarrassment. It's like something still in trial development in 2010. And the only free part is you can scroll through profiles mindlessly - anything else u got to pay. Again even the marketing 'free' is pathetically outdated and I cant believe they get a pass for calling it free. I wish only bad things for this business. Bad product, slow, clunky, misleading, greed mongers. A disgrace.\", 'This is ridiculous! App features don\\'t even work. I need to verify my passport in Japan and I\\'ve submitted many many times with the double page easily seen and it won\\'t work!!! So I have a paid subscription and I can\\'t even use the application! I contacted support many times but they just reply back with \"here are a few tips with your problem\" no the problem isn\\'t me, it\\'s your shifty application.', \"Awful UI experience. It's clunky and takes up far too much space from things you actually wanna see. Not to mention that the only consistent notification you get is if you match. You tend to miss messages sent by matches even when you're in the app because notifications simply don't happen. Also if you use the app for to much in one sitting it starts to lag horribly.\", \"Well, for starters, Tinder is quite a good app when it comes to dating. I've met decent people from both genders to make friends with and dated a couple ladies who... let's just say we were not meant to be together, hence it was on our end. Now, my problem with the app lies in 2 major updates. First, if the devs would apply the photo verification feature, it would help eliminate fake profiles. Secondly, having to notify users where texts has been read would solve a lot of question marks.
