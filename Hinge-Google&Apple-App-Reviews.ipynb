It works well, makes it easier to start conversations and share things about yourself, and also makes it easier to gauge someone else’s profile. \\n2) They allow you to sort by things like age range, ethnicity, religion, etc. If you pay for a subscription, they let you sort by things like politics, education level, and whether they drink, smoke, etc. \\n3) They allow you to put whether you’re vaccinated or not on your profile. However, they do not let you sort by whether people are vaccinated, which is what cost it a star (since that’s a bit of a dealbreaker for me). Basically, if you’re looking for a good, flexible app that you don’t have to pay to get a date on, this is a good one. That said, there are ways to pay to increase efficiency, and I wish you could sort by more for free. I know this is unlikely, but if a developer is reading this: please allow for sorting by vaccination status, and please don’t hide that one behind a paywall. Also, maybe add an option to say “unable to be vaccinated” for people who are allergic or such, as opposed to merely “not vaccinated,” since that would affect my judgement.\\n\\nEDIT: Okay, so I feel like your priorities for sorting are kinda out of whack. Like, we’re able to sort by race/ethnicity for free, but not whether or not our prospective partner smokes or uses drugs? Wish it was the other way around.',\n",

The more information on your profile or another persons profile increases the chances of you liking something other than just their looks. I found that this has led to much more engaging and relatable matches with others, not only that but leading those comments on their profile has led to easier conversations as it is a total ice breaker. The conversation starts with the comment that you made after you match and you can build off of what you sent. I found this has led to more genuine conversations and has been a overall amazing experience. \\n\\nI’ve had tinder and bumble for several years now, and I found the whole experience to be very difficult with few matches and disinterested people; even when I use the paid subscriptions little changed.

There’s so many features that allow a person to be able to follow up on people who like them without the use of a paid subscription.

That doesn’t mean it’s going to provide a fairy tail opportunity, or even a fun one, but the way profiles are designed and integrated into the brief response sections makes this a much better option than Tinder, and even Bumble.\\n\\nAs others have mentioned in their reviews, squelching the ability to like photos without leaving a substantive comment should be the default.  That’s simply too much like Tinder/Facebook and doesn’t really provide anything meaningful for the app.  It definitely promotes the type of “drive-by” behavior that’s a scourge on Tinder.  Leaving a comment requires forethought about what to say, what kind of tone you want to convey, and engaging with another user’s profile.  You’re also much more likely to respond to folks who leave commentary, even if you don’t plan on going on a date, and that’s a very healthy approach compared to other apps.\\n\\nAs always, your mileage may vary. If you live in a small place you’re likely going to need to increase the radius, or maybe even take a step toward looking to move somewhere bigger in the future. There is still ghosting, likely related to the feature I mentioned above, but that’s just part of the process.

Went on a first date with people I thought we could match, glad we didn’t. Every single guy I met was very respectful never had to talk to a guy that was gross. Also Tip: If you are starting a conversation just say from the jump what are you looking for? Those were one of my first questions. I knew I was looking for a relationship and when guys said they were looking for something casual I would tell them that I am not longer interested. In a respectful way. Always be respectful and consider of others feelings. And if you go in a first date I use that just to talk and get to know the person. Never kiss or have any other advantages. \\n\\nI was lucky most guys I met on hinge were well behaved. As in the past I tried other dating apps and most people are gross, everyone is looking for hook ups. And the apps are expensive if you want to filter the options. The app is great even on the free version. Easy to engage conversation with the prompts also, is about the pics. Use the best you can use and show your face completely.',\n",

Instead you only notify them the next time they try to like someone… following Tinder’s business model. I don’t like it and it deteriorates the more “genuine” image that Hinge has marketed for itself. But then again, it is somewhat expected since both are owned by the same company. \\n\\nReview: In my opinion, Hinge is the better option in terms of quality matches compared to Tinder or apps like it. Requiring a minimum of 6 photos and 3 prompts, it forces users to put actual effort into creating their profile compared to Tinder’s (overly) simple, quick, and easy setup. One can assume that, because of these extra steps, the users of the app are a bit more invested or serious about dating. Then of course there’s the non-swiping liking system that makes users more conscious of their selections.  All that’s good.\\n\\nThe bad: not a fan of the algorithm. Sometimes I download the app and get phenomenal matches who are interesting and physically attractive. Other times I open the app and it’s a tragedy after each profile. I wonder why since my prompts and photos seldom change. Of course the app rewards active users but then again sometimes I question. Also not a fan of the change where you don’t know you run out of likes until you like someone. I think it preys on people’s fear of missing out… in hopes of driving profits.',\n",

Only giving it 3 stars because I can’t add a short bio like I can on Tinder & Bumble and a couple other reasons. This app has some of the most expensive pay walls. $90 for 6m and you really don’t get much at all over an unpaid subscription. Add a permanent premium access pay wall that’s COMPETITIVE, and I bet you’d get more usage. Add that & a bio and you’d surely stomp out Tinder & Bumble. Or at least sway more people to the app. I’ve never met anyone on this app cause most women can’t hold a conversation let alone find time to reply, but maybe once I’m able to write a bio, that could change and allow me to find someone who actually wants to talk & date 🤷🏻\\u200d♂️ \\n\\nAlgorithm could use some work too. Distance reached is small. Very small. Won’t even encompass my whole state, or even the next nearest large city. I travel A LOT and it’d be nice to window shop to places I’ll be traveling too considering I’m looking to move as well. Focus up and get more competitive. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻.

The custom features are also a time savor. It’s easy to quickly identify basic deal-breakers (smoking, has kids, doesn’t want kids, vaccinated, etc.). Also, the prompts and captions encourage users to not judge someone solely passed on their appearance.\\n\\nHowever, Hinge is another app that benefits women more than men. The average man usually receives a few likes (if any) per week, while an attractive women receive multiple likes and compliments every day. Therefore, most women doesn’t need to spend time liking profiles or sending the first message because the likes and compliments come to them. However, this is also potentially a lose-lose situation. Women are overwhelmed with messages and likes and struggle to find time to respond to even a handful of men and men feel ignored, hopeless, and depressed. \\n\\nI’ve used Hinge for about a month and matched with about seven women, and I only received one response, and it went no where.

The issue as usual is the matches not even talk when they like first and barely talk when a conversation is initiated which makes no sense, most will unmatch out of nowhere, and the lack of communication leads to pointless conversations and not actually meeting up. For us who are looking for more than an ego boost we want more substance. If you can promote profiles to drive them to make an effort and use the app for dating for more in person instead of a bunch of matches who just want to talk it would be more of a success. No one really wants to just have a conversation and get blown off so for those who do they don’t need to be on the app. It’s a waste of time for us who take it seriously. If you can market on the app a way to show profiles that of course the right person to actually meet up and use the app the way it’s supposed to then it’ll make people take it seriously as they should. It overall is one of my favorite dating apps. I get a lot of matches and I’m tired of them not really talking and barely putting in an effort to make more of a connection when they usually make the first like to me.

I remembered seeing some funny commercials for Hinge and decided to check it out. The atmosphere was completely different, immediately. It felt warm and inviting, and I loved that your profile was more than just pictures. The prompts are amazing conversation starters that eased me into chats that were more in-depth and skipped the awkward small talk. I matched with my current boyfriend on my first or second day on the app. I went into Hinge with no expectations; I was simply curious to compare it with Tinder. I matched with people, had conversations, went on a couple first dates. I loved the experience, and everyone I talked to seemed to be looking for a serious relationship like I was. I knew my boyfriend was the one before we even met in person. Because there was no awkward introduction stage, we got to know each other quickly and we clicked instantly.

My major criticism is that you pay a $65 subscription fee for 3 months, which gets you the ability to see who has liked you and unlimited likes. The app then “finds your preferences” and sorts potential matches into “standouts” where you have to buy a rose (currently 3 for $10) to be their first visible like. According to the “Learn More” link on the Standouts page, this is “where you'll find a bonus batch of content from people most your type you won't see elsewhere”. AKA, as the app learns your preferences it locks your most likely matches behind a paywall where you pay to play for each “rose”.  Most guys know from dating apps, there’s a low likelihood of reciprocation for any one person, so the sky’s the limit on how much you can spend. In my opinion, this is very disingenuous by essentially holding hostage the people you are most likely to be interested in for additional payments. The more roses you buy the cheaper they are, but having this in addition to the subscription fee is ridiculous. Money grabbing at its finest and shady at best if you ask me. For all my cute girls out there, congratulations, you’re now making Hinge up to $3.33 for each guy that sends you a “rose”. Hinge has become a cheap pimp.

We lived less than 45 mins away from each other basically all of our high school and early young adulthood years. I was on a trip in mississippi and he was there for his basic training 2 months before we matched. I got back home a few days after he graduated basic, already back at his house and getting his first base assignment a day before we met. Instant match, hung out for only a week before he had to go to his base across country, within about 3-4 days he asked if I wanted to go with him. Next thing you know I was on a plane 3 months later on the way to a whole new state and a whole new life. We have now been married for 2 years this coming December. I know this sounds almost insane and something someone gets paid to write a review of but i can’t tell you how amazing it is to wake up every morning next to him, the man I love with all of my heart and soul. This app made my life I have today possible and I can never describe how grateful I am to have the opportunity to have had it. Also fate has a funny way of catching you I’ll tell you that.

       "  'review': 'So to begin this review I want to point out that Hinge had the generosity of providing me with a 30 day preferred membership, probably as a welcome to the app. Although they in no way made me write a review, I still feel that doing so is fair to reciprocate their generosity. Like others users have mentioned, I’m somewhat missing the value in paying for a preferred membership, because it only works if others have it, in my case women. Since you can only like a few people at a time and review your queue of matches in a limited manner as a free user, if you get a lot of hits on your profile you’re not going to contact them for a while. That being said, if a preferred member had priority in other’s match queue, it would add much more value. Additionally, the app should work towards making sure women actually respond to you once you’ve made contact, because it’s another big issue. Finally, the number of people who were actually similar in my personality and in my league was dwindled so quickly that now it just feeds me whatever profiles it has lying around, and not even a week into the app I’m out of matchable women. As it stands right now, I certainly wouldn’t spend any money on this experience, but given work it could be a truly revolutionary app as it claims. Since I’m a young guy in a big market I would love to continue providing my feedback and working to improve the app if the developers are interested.',\n",

I have never in my however many years of online/app dating, regardless of the site or platform, been able to meet someone I was compatible with. It’s difficult sorting through, what is essentially lists and lists of people (who sometimes distract you with their pretty faces and not much else), hoping that you find someone who is compatible with you. These new changes that aim to get you off the app, whatever they are, they work. After being on here for a couple/few months, Hinge more and more started to send me men I found attractive and was more likely to have good conversation with. I met a guy that I really like, and we’ve been seeing each other for less than a couple months but I have never met a man who I could talk to for hours on end like this. We did the video calls and the questioning game through Hinge and eventually met up for a social distanced picnic. He seems like the type of guy I’ve been wanting to meet for a while. It’s like Hinge is a close friend who knows what I like and set me up on a blind date. Our non-romantic and romantic compatibility and attraction is kind of insane.

       "  'review': 'Hinge has often been the dating app I most recommend to people looking to try online dating because it’s a more wholesome matching experience and it allows for a better profile/representation of yourself (which I’ve always liked about this app). However, lately there have been a few changes that have really shot the approachability of this app in my opinion. The increased pricing for membership, the removal of free “Most Compatible” in exchange for the introduction of the “Standouts” feature where you pay an absurdly high price for roses (which is the only way to match with the people grouped into this area of the app) is a big let down. There’s also a bug with roughly 20% of profiles I come across in the standard Discovery section where pictures simply do not load in their frames (even after quitting the app and reloading). I’ve received 2 total likes and 0 replies in the past month (which is drastically fewer than I’ve ever seen in the past with the app) which makes me wonder if I may have similarly bugged images on my profile, and it’s also a shame because that would mean the $4 roses I’ve paid for and sent were basically burners. With the new direction it seems the app wants to go to make more revenue (which I do understand, everyone wants to make more money) I haven’t felt like the choices made for new features have produced a better app for the single person using it.',\n",

Bumble is also pretty good. So far Bumble hasn’t appealed to the mega masses. When it does it will be a waste of time like Tinder and Match. But for now Hinge doesn’t have mass appeal but use that to your advantage. It’s better to have less people and appeal to public less because these people will have higher quality ppl then on the apps used by the mass public.

I did not find this out until conversing with either of them at some length and drilling to the bottom of it.

I know Hinge is a more casual dating service, but yet I wish this information would have been more upfront.  Even so, both women have still become good friends and I was still encouraged to meet both of them given the higher quality of person they each are.

I want the ability to search within the entirety of the US or down to 5 miles. There is a very inefficient way to mess with it by changing your location but then you have to waste prompts explaining it and I’m sure the other people don’t necessarily want to deal with that. I should be able to set it to nationwide or however far and see other people who have me within their own search range.

Now it hijacks the top profiles and hides them in the highlights and charges $3 to send the person a Rose so you can look like a simp. Regular likes > roses in all but the most rare cases. Furthermore, because the most liked profiles get put in highlights, as they put more profiles in the highlights section, the more lesser profiles get liked, ipso facto they now become the new top profiles and get put in the highlights. Now there’s no longer a need to worry about running out of likes on the unpaid version because you won’t run across enough people in a day to use all of your allocated likes, as anyone worth liking is now in the highlights. Also, even when I paid for the premium, after the first week my profile stops getting liked as often, instead I end up with someone randomly giving me a rose here and there. Which I believe indicates I’ve been put in the highlights... which in turn lessens how often my profile is liked.

Not as many likes as other apps so if you match with someone, they have chosen you more carefully than other apps that allow you to like every single person you pass through. You can put distance settings for free and reverse a pass. If you run out of people it gives you an option to see the people you passed again or you can put the distance setting further. The bulk of the things you need to find matches and talk with people is free.

The idea of making interactions with people extend beyond a simple “like” is great because it gives people (mainly men) an opportunity to stand out on their first impression. Unfortunately this innovation is stifled by seemingly worse algorithms for matching people and no major incentive to engage female users (see Bumble) into making or maintaining conversations with the overwhelming number of men that are matching/liking/commenting on their profiles.\\n\\nAnother issue I find is the forceful “prompting” that seems to beat myself and others into answering uncomfortable/staged questions that may seem like icebreakers on the surface but in reality gives people that all too familiar feeling of introducing themselves to a group of strangers with “3 fun facts about themselves”.  I think this unfortunately has the effect of making everybody using this platform seem nervous and uncomfortable instead of fun and date-able.\\n\\nIn general, I’ve also found that the people Hinge suggests to me are seemingly way less compatible or similar to me in comparison to other apps.

Which is totally fine, but don’t make them exclusive to that page and not in the mix on discover. And this is BECAUSE roses are apparently a huge turnoff. I have a 1% return on sending roses rather than hearts. And pretty much the opposite on hearts. I have ZERO problem with the monetization structure and paying to have the best guys for me filtered into one convenient place. But for the love of god let me just send them regular hearts or be able to come across them in discover. I think roses come across as too eager and advertise that you pay to date, inferring you’re some Cretan that needs to pay. And it’s definitely not the case. I personally am just on there because I appreciate the algorithm aligning me with guys I’m incredibly discerning about since I’m serious about finding a match. Oh Hinge please help 😫',\n",

So I checked to see if I could upgrade and it said that there was an error. I even tried calling my contacts and said it was an error. I messaged the customer service department and haven’t heard back. I literally missed 2 dates because of this (who probably believe I unmatched them.) I got on bumble and messaged someone else who I had matched with on Hinge and he said my profile isn’t showing anymore. This is so unfortunate because I really meshed well with one of the guys I matched with. This bug needs to be fixed and fixed quickly so it doesn’t make it seem like people are being ghosted when they aren’t.

You can only contact Standouts by sending them a rose. (Yeah…it feels like The Bachelor) You get 1 rose/week for free, and beyond that, you have to pay for more. They’re not cheap. \\nSecond: BOTS! I’ve seen a significant increase in the number of bots since I started using. And they’re usually in the Standouts. This morning I noticed at least 3-4 in the mix. They’re always extremely conventionally attractive, from another country, their personal info has something nonsensical in it, the prompts mention marriage or long term relationships, and pics feature them w/animals. If you connect w/ them, they immediately respond and after a few messages, ask for your phone number or try to get you on What’sapp. I always report them, but I can’t even imagine how many users are unwittingly spending money on roses for bots.

No dealing with algorithms that throw you to the bottom of the stack if you’re not the most conventionally attractive individual.

The problem with this is that you get an unlimited amount of ‘likes’ per day, meaning women get their inbox slammed with ‘likes’.

After you set up your account and start swiping, hinge starts to collect data about the type of person you’re interested in.

In order to interact with anyone in the stand out category you have to have a rose, hinge gives you one free rose a week. Otherwise you can buy roses in packages with the lowest being three roses for almost $10. Most people don’t want to pay. They want to use the free access in the app and just swipe. The problem with that is after the app has gathered data about the people you like you’re no longer going to see people that you’re interested in the free section. Example, I’m a tall woman who likes tall men. I only swiped on guys who were over 6’ tall. Now when I use the app most of the guys that they show me are  5’7” or 5’8”. Supposedly, on occasion some people from your standouts will appear in the regular feed but it’s really rare.

If the app can figure out how to make dating more successful and not just being different only be negating the swipe feature, then I can give 5 stars.

Two, I can echo on the other reviews claiming this is a “classier dating app” - I feel like most of the people I came across want something serious but of course that part is individual and up to your discretion, whatever tickles your fancy. But honestly I have met some quality guys (I’m sure the same for girls!) here, some I consider friends now even when things didn’t work out for the long run.\\n\\nWhichever side of the fence you’re on, I have nothing but good things to say about Hinge and hope you get to experience the same fun and excitement in meeting the right person. \\n\\nPS! Amazon’s critically acclaimed series “Modern Love” has an episode inspired by the love story of the CEO of Hinge! Such a feel good show and a really well written episode honestly 🤗 episode 2 by the way- you’re welcome!!!',\n",

We have inside jokes all the time that I can read her mind because we are so similar (90% of the time I can read her mind). We’re planning to move in together this April when my apartment lease is over. She talks about how she can’t wait for me to marry her some day.

It’s simple to use, doesn’t give weird vibes like other dating apps, and makes it easy to share and see values/beliefs. It’s a cool way to make connections with people who share your views and interests. And it seems like the app is catching on! One of my friends is now engaged thanks to connecting with someone on here. I’m a millennial in an area of primarily retired age people, plus I’m super picky about who I meet, and I’ve been on several in-person dates with decent people in a matter of months. That’s saying something for the app’s popularity. Another friend of mine who’s only slightly less picky than me connected with a great guy and went out with him within 3 days of downloading the app. They connected because of shared values/beliefs that were easily seen as they were sifting though profiles.\\nIf you’re thinking about it, just download it.

Second, it has tons of ways to customize your bio with prompts, making sound clips, video, etc. third, the preference list is the best out there as well, you can select different types you’re looking for and make “dealbreaker’s” to set what you’re looking for. you can also send messages to people you like. It does have its downsides, for example, you only get 10 likes per day! which is substantially lower than most apps, most dating apps, won’t let you have at least 20. another big downside is a lot, and I mean a LOT of the features that would be standard on most other dating apps you have to pay for, like 90% of the app is a pay-wall. But It does have a great free version. There are only 2 dating app I would pay for, and this would be one of them. I highly recommend if you’re looking for a great starting dating app it would be this one. it is the app designed to be deleted after all. ;)',\n",

If you consider yourself repulsive or a prostitute, welcome to Hinge this is the place for you. But knowing this, the Hinge team has made it intentionally difficult to use the app, which induces user fatigue to make sure you can’t swipe through volume because their volume is extremely low value. The app has a dark patterns based UI, and the database of people is just horrific - as if everyone who had no success on every other app just created their own - yeah this is it. This is the homeless camp of dating apps, the unhealthy people club of dating apps, the “I’ve given up trying and I’m bitter and fat” club; and they’re all home at Hinge. And because the UI is so difficult you can’t swipe left - it takes literal seconds to X someone and their X button is intentionally placed in a bad spot and takes 2-3 taps each time to get it to trigger - all intentional UI dark patterns. Because of this, you’ll end up wasting hours of your life and get nowhere. There are no quality matches on Hinge. Period. Don’t waste your time, this app is a scam.',\n",

Everyone needs love and standards of beauty can be somewhat subjective, I’m not trying to put others down. But this is a repeatable pattern with Hinge and after the two or so weeks ‘honeymoon’ period, the app becomes nothing but a waste of time.

Would it were so, but in the honeymoon period I did match with several attractive women, went out on dates with two of them, and am still seeing one (been on our third date as of now).

This is a wonderful concept and the main reason I downloaded it and purchased a subscription. However, there are major flaws that need to be fixed for it to work. First, many profiles are incomplete and have little to no details about the person. Two, users have the ability to hide major details such as employment status, whether they have kids, whether they smoke, height, and much more! Another thing that is concerning is education is “always hidden” and the user can’t choose to display their level of education. The only way to let others know that you graduated high school or college is to actually name the school, which is problematic for some people. These issues can be dealbreakers for folks and are fundamental questions. Three, there are no questions about what type of relationship the person is seeking. While I’d like to assume that everyone on the app is looking for something committed and monogamous, that’s not always the case.\\n\\nIn summary, while the concept of the app is refreshing and very promising, it is lacking in real, authentic detail and feels like I’m navigating in the dark.

Until these apps developers are actually considerate of height as a critical factor and know how demoralizing it is, I am deleting these apps for probably what will be forever since I know all these money hungry devs won’t make it a free feature.

I live in a relatively small town, and not a lot of people use the app. I’ve liked almost everyone who has the same preferences in town and none of them matched with me. I lowered my preferences, tried again, same results. I would be willing to travel an hour/hour and a half to see someone, so I widened my radius, and after liking a lot of my results, got nowhere. With no matches in my town, and no matches in my region, I’m either really unattractive, people aren’t as willing to travel a bit, or there’s just not enough people in my area using the app. Would be great for people living in large cities.',\n",

Now I can just answer a few ice breakers on hinge, upload a few photos and get the party started! I’m also loving the pool of eligible bachelors!\\n\\nMy biggest gripe is with the app itself. If there are convos that have gone stagnant you have the option to unmatch with someone (which cuts ties with them completely) or hide their profile. I’ve tried hiding several profiles of guys that I’m not currently talking to but they keep popping back up in my inbox whenever I open the app. I don’t want to unmatch because some folks are just slow to respond (or it shows I’m next to respond when it really should be their turn based on how the convo ended) but I hate seeing their messages in my inbox as if it’s a new message I need to respond to. I don’t need the “your turn prompt.” There should be an option to turn this off so that I can focus solely on active conversations.',\n",

But the major caveat is that it’s extremely limiting to only be able to set your gender as woman/man and same with what you’re looking for. I would suggest at least adding the option of non-binary if not also trans femme and trans masc and allowing people to check multiple boxes for what they’re looking for. I think the lack of this makes this app very unfriendly to trans people. Additionally as a queer woman I’ve found that often straight couples looking for a threesome with a woman will list themselves as a queer woman which I find extremely upsetting—I have listed myself as looking for women so I do not want to see a picture of a man in his underwear in my feed!! I think it could help to add an additional option to list yourself as a couple and to list yourself as interested in couples.

I really appreciated the check in with the app after the date and such. \\n\\nThen I saw his profile and I was immediately interested because of the extra layers of depth you can get and then when we started talking I still wasn’t sure, but online communication can be easily misunderstood and such so we went on our first date and we’ll I was kinda smitten. \\n\\nWe honestly wouldn’t have meet via other dating apps because of this dating radius. He lives almost an hour away from me and well I wasn’t really looking in that direction for anyone anyway and yet here we are. \\n\\nI keep seeing the commercials for the app and we both have told people to give it a try. Because it’s different and it you are looking for depth and such, why not try something that gives you a fighting chance, because when nothing but pictures and a basic one liner are you’re options you don’t really feel motivated. \\n\\nHinge helped me find someone that I highly doubt I would have found somewhere else.

For example, the app no longer notifies you when you run out of swipes. Now, you must attempt to swipe at which point it asks you for money. THIS IS A BIG CHANGE. I sometimess swipe left on 20-30 people before I swipe right on one. This one change has turned what use to be only positive experiences, into a permanently negative one.

The way the system is set up gives you a chance to like a quote, viewpoint, answer and of course pictures.

In my experience, there’s nothing on their profile that interests me and, very often, the profile only has pictures that don’t show a person. It’s either random or based on a very flawed algorithm. This is all happening in an app that also doesn’t have many people in it, apparently. The company should definitely do more marketing to attract many, MANY more users.

I don’t send derogatory or offensive messages, I had nice proper pictures, and didn’t use profanity. I had a really nice profile. I appealed the banned and the declined it at first but in May 2022 I ended up receive an email stating that they decided to allow my account right. I was happy about that as I didn’t do anything wrong to begin with! I re created an account, and had a great experience….. for about a week and then it was banned and deleted in the midst of literally looking through profiles. I sent an email asking why does this keep happening. I didn’t even try to appeal this time.

I have had one interaction in Hinge in the past several months, in which case I said “hello again” to someone I had previously matched with. That was a few weeks before I tried logging in again and with no other recent interactions I cannot imagine what ese could have led to the ban. There appears to be no actual vetting process regarding banning as to whether reports are real or false, and there is zero transparency regarding why you have been banned. I have never had the slightest similar issue with Bumble or Tinder and have interacted with dozens more interactions. Furthermore upon looking into this, I am definitely not alone. Dozens of users on reddit have reported the same thing with identical responses from the nonexistent customer service, both men and women. Hinge clearly needs to iron out their suspension/banning process or provide temporary suspensions while looking into the reality of the issues.',\n",

First is that this app does not seem to have a simple way of placing an account on “hold“ and then easily “reactivating” it like all the other online dating apps have. I realize their tagline is “designed to be deleted”, however that’s not how things typically work in real life. You may meet someone and decide to see where things go, and therefore want to put your account on “hold“ and not necessarily delete it. If say, two weeks later things don’t pan out with that person, you shouldn’t have to re-create an entirely new account, upload pictures, etc.\\n\\nAnother negative is there seems to be too much reliance on “linking to Facebook“ for the creation of your account. Guess what Hinge? Not everyone uses Facebook.\\n\\nLastly, their customer support is literally the worst that I’ve ever experience for any tech product in the past 30 years. Literally useless.

That is uncanny! The app should adjust their system to a more free user friendly setting. I have a hard time thus far in the 21st century finding other ethnic groups to date in. So I’d hate to remove that option to only have the white people be the 99% on the app. I am not sure if this app is for caucasian’s or if it’s actually supposed to be friendly to all races? Either way I think the price is way to high, this definitely isn’t a high end app that draws in a demographic of financially free and or stable  anyways!',\n",

It should either be required that a state is entered or it should list miles away. Also their algorithm is really bad. They have a feature called ‘most compatible’ that brings up someones profile you are supposedly compatible with and a majority of the time these are the opposite of people I would actually want to date.

More specific filters: One thing Bumble does better than anyone is the amount of creative filters you can apply to what you’re looking for. For example: If I really want to find folks who just want something casual, I can filter only for that specific preference. Can’t really do that actively on Hinge. So for the most part, you run into a lot of folks that don’t fit your preference. \\n\\n 2. Aesthetic issues: Hinge might have one of the most boring looking interfaces out of all the apps. Such a heavy use of black and white. To the point where even conversations get annoying to look at with the dull purple. The app doesn’t feel flashy and exciting. Feels like I’m about to get married through my phone and a lot of us are not here for that. \\n\\n 3. Number of free likes: Hinge prides itself on being a cut above the other apps: the app to be deleted. Which is an ironic statement to make. However, the number of free likes is a disappointment and embarrassing. It feels just like every other app in that way.\\n\\n4. Algorithm vs. non-white people: If you’re a non-white person, have fun getting any likes on your profile. The app feels like it’s stacked against you. That’s all I can really say.

You get plenty of access as a free user, i have never paid for a subscription so i can’t say anything about the extra features hinge has to offer. Overall hinge is my favorite dating app out there because i get quality matches, people can actively like you or you them, comment on your profile, and you aren't hidden behind a blur. \\n\\nMy one gripe is sometimes you come across people promoting content, but you can pass on them or report them, whether anything happens after that, who knows? But its not as abundant on hinge as it is on other apps from a straight males perspective. \\n\\nMy issue with hinge is the messaging, just sending messages, typing them, is rough, maybe its my device but for whatever reason it feels like there is a text limit without the app specifying there is one. If you type just enough in a message you get overlapping text, you cant scroll through what you typed if its long, text becomes invisible while typing a message, or you type and you cant even scroll to the section where the newest letters are appearing. Its very frustrating, something i do not experience in any other app with messaging features.\",\n",

My account had nothing explicit or offensive on it, which leads me to believe that nobody actually reviewed the report on my account to verify if it was correct.

So now, that girl totally believes I stood her up. I reached out to their customer service to let them know that they should reach out to her to prevent any disappointment. But I still haven’t heard back and it’s been several days. Personally I give them this one star review because their customer service and cancellation policy seems totally unacceptable, disheartening and against their mission.',\n",

So essentially I have to pay for the CHANCE to talk to a potential match. These roses are great because it gives scarcity to the types of likes but, hiding good potential matches behind the paywall just makes the app feel like a waste of my time.',\n",

Having something optional on your profile that lists how your mental health is could be beneficial to those that may suffer from depression, anxiety, or autism spectrum disorder. If users can filter out someone that drinks or smokes than this should be an option as well. Most of the times someone will never know what someone is struggling with long term unless they mention it, and with a filter for this, others would know right away and can decide whether or not they want to like this user.

Recently, however, it seems like at least 5 to 10 times a day, I’m seeing profiles put together for escorts (that are also very likely bots). All of their responses to the Hinge profile prompts reference snapchat accounts and have obscene, sexual language. Worse, the responses are all the same (and contain obscene words), so it would be very easy for Hinge to codify rules and program these profiles out of the platform, but they haven’t, and this has been going on for weeks, despite reporting every profile I see like this. The profiles are also filled with either sexually suggestive or outright NSFW photographs. I’m a male that is interested in dating females, so I’m not sure if females looking for males to date on the platform are seeing similar profiles created for that particular audience, but it is becoming on my end of the platform. It’s a shame Hinge has let themselves fall victim to this and are doing nothing about it, because even as big a cesspool as Tinder is, and while it is filled with bots and scammers  it doesn’t have this issue with obscene profiles.',\n",

For example, I set my distance to a certain radius and said it was a dealbreaker so that I wouldn’t match with people too far away, because I’m not interested in long distance or having to drive back and forth to other cities for dates. But I consistently get people in my feed who live 80+ miles away!  I live in a decent sized city with a sprawling metro area, it’s not like there aren’t enough people in the radius I selected!  \\n\\nI also don’t want kids and set wanting kids as a dealbreaker and I get tons of people in my feed who want children or even already have them. That’s a HUGE flaw in the system because I am fundamentally incompatible with them. \\n\\nI’m also set to see both men and women as I am bi, but ONLY men show up in my feed.

There isn’t much room to be creative with some of these; the sole response to “I’m the kind of texter who” I have ever come across is that they respond immediately or not for a long time. It’s hard to answer a lot of these prompts without looking like you’d fail a CATCHPA test. Also not helping is the character limit being so short—it practically encourages these easy, dry, and lifeless answers.\\n\\nThe end result has been that going through the profiles is less like seeing creative, interesting answers (which, on the rare occasion it happens, I see why some of these reviews swear by this app) and more like combing through a rather boring pool of profiles.

At other times, I see a profile I like and I want to compose a thoughtful comment, but if I have to take a phone call or do something at work, I lose the chance.

Starting on the concept of marriage first is odd. “Hi I’m here to get married.” “Let’s start the interviews.” Just seems backwards to me. I have been on this for well over a year. There are VERY FEW profiles in my age range and classification. The most compatible feature is always way off. At times it isn’t even the right gender (or gender expression). Suggestions: -Tap and expand photos. You need to be able to see the photos. Just pinch zoom hold is awful. -Dark/night mode is missing-Weight/body filter is important -Add a BFF feature. In today’s social distancing world, it’s hard to meet other people. It’s hard to make new friends. This app would be good at this. And you never know. It could also lead to .... ‘marriage’.',\n",

I think the only problem with Hinge is that it needs more users. So skip the other apps and download Hinge!',\n",

I told a few people who I knew used the app as well and they all said it happened to them too (not at the same time), so that was a little shady.

But that’s syntactically the same thing as “most attractive” because the people who get the most likes are the most attractive ones. So in essence, Hinge separates its users into the beautiful 1% (which you must pay $2.99 to interact with) and the normal 99%. Other dating apps also do this (Scruff shows you “most woofed” for example), but Hinge is the only one that has the audacity to charge you to interact with them. And no, they have nothing to do with my type.

Prices are absurd, and the return on investment is non-existent. For example, I spent $20 on a “super boost”, which is supposed to increase visibility of your profile for 24 hours. During this 24 hour period, I only received three “likes”. There is also an entire section called “Standouts” which is locked behind a paywall. Hinge intentionally hides the profiles of more conventionally attractive people behind this paywall, and you will never come across them in the normal deck. In order to “like” anyone in this section, you need to send a rose. You only get one free rose per week. If you want to buy more you can either spend $10 for 3, $30 for 12, or $75 for 50, so at a MINIMUM you are spending $1.50 just to swipe right on someone.\\n\\nYour first inclination might be to disregard my experience and blame it on my profile, pictures, etc., but consider that prior to Match Group’s acquisition I met a lot of really great people on Hinge, and I also have more luck on other dating apps with the SAME PHOTOS, which means it is Hinge in it’s current state that is the problem. \\n\\nFor context, I am a early-30’s male in California.',\n",

I’ve also come across profiles that have responses to their prompts that are completely unrelated. You can also look to filter through only men or women based off your preferences, (Im gay) but I’ve come across “straight” men (probably spam accounts), and women in my feed which is an automatic no.

I think you can learn a lot from someone just looking at those things, even if they don’t develop their profile you get a picture of them.

When you pay premium you get unlimited likes, and you can use some filters like “has no kids” for example. You have to pay extra for roses and standouts! I think if you pay premium you get a better pool of people. I noticed with the regular version people would be way too odd and the “most compatible person” was a joke honestly. I’m not going to renew my premium version because of that. But because people have to make more effort I think you can get something more serious out of this.',\n",

Three small prompts aren’t really enough to get a sense of someone. I think they should add a few (limited) free-form, required fields where people can give us a better glimpse of who they are. \\n- The mileage search preference can only be: 1) between 1-100 miles, or 2) 100 miles to infinity. Nothing in between. \\n- Once you “like” someone, you have no record of that action anywhere. It’s by design, so you only see people who “like” you back. I’m thinking, well surely I won’t see the same profile I’ve already liked (but haven’t yet heard from), right? Wrong. That happened to me this morning. I almost liked the same guy within an hour, making me look like some kind of creepy stalker. \\n- Also by design, the apps continues circling the same profiles I’ve declined back around. After 4-5 declines, wouldn’t you think it’s safe to say I’m NOT INTERESTED?\\n- Low engagement rate so far. Though Match overwhelmed me, I got almost 100% response rate from the guys I messaged. I’m guessing it’s been less than 50% on Hinge. Again I can’t say for sure, since I can’t even see how many profiles I’ve “liked”. Two out of maybe 6 guys who messaged me were scammers.

Take a page from facebook’s new dating feature, which surprisingly gets some of these things right. Right now it feels like Hinge is just designed to maximize your engagement and pressure you to spend time in the app, so, like their slogan says, maybe it IS time to delete this one. 🧐',\n",

If hinge wants to be the “different” dating app that actually gets people a partner - - not just a single date of small chat or sadly weeks of small chat on the app there should be some type of post “meet up” survey. While you can block and report a user/profile in the app, I’d like to see a follow up survey of that would possibly start slimming down the pen pals and show the users who are on the app for its purpose.

There are two major major issues. \\n\\nOne (honestly the less important) reason is that matching with standouts puts a paywall to quality matches. There is no consent from individuals to be put behind that paywall. Hinge makes money off of more “attractive” people by forcing users to pay to match with them. And those people in the standouts do not have the opportunity to consent to being used by the app for that purpose. That is queasy but honestly more of a moral issue. \\n\\nThe second issue is practical, and I would argue matters more to users. “Roses” in the standouts section are akin to super-likes. They are the only option in the standouts section, and they set up inherent power imbalances that never work out in favor of the sender. It comes off as desperate and cringey. While hinge claims they have higher rates of matches with roses, I would like to see the data, because this does not align with my or others experience (as far as I have heard). \\n\\nIf you’re not going to stop monetizing attractive people without their consent, at the very least allow users to send regular likes to people in standouts.

It solves the problem in online dating of trying to find opening conversations.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the chatting mechanism, in which said conversations are supposed to occur is riddled with issues.  Sometimes the push notifications with a message will be sent to my phone while the actual message is absent from the app.  Thankfully, I have multiple devices handy and can usually see the message on one of the other devices.  But if was a normal person with only a single smartphone with this app, I might not ever get my messages.  With online dating, that can be critical.  I don’t want to ghost someone inadvertently.

The location for users on Hinge is useless and confusing — it’s often so specific/narrow it’ll display the street the person happens to be at, rather than the town they live in. It’s difficult to discern if the person lives there or just happens to be there in that moment. The “personalized” matches are just random people. If you have the free version, it’s difficult to see all the people who’ve liked you because... you can’t. It’s blocked. Only the most recent person is visible and I’m hesitant to pay extra because most women (in my experience) don’t reply to messages anyway. The paid options are also pretty pricy, especially now during a pandemic (2020). Searching by distance is also frustrating — the app often shows you people 100+ miles outside your selected range, which isn’t helpful.',\n",

I’m in NYC and the bulk of the women on here are horrendously overweight, and if you do find a random attractive woman she is model caliber and you can see her Instagram feed clearly has a boyfriend. So this is my major beef with the app, there is no cleansing of profiles that are inactive or have a significant other - two massive flaws. The second is that living in NYC I have better chances making a quality match if I just walked on the street, I say this because Hinge makes zero effort to match me with like minded people. I’m a eligible bachelor who is a fashion designer and is very attractive yet all my feed is obese women? How is that quality over quantity?

Just because it says it’s my turn, let’s a lot of guys think I have to drive the conversation because really they are not relying a lot on conversation skills.  It’s my opinion that if you’re getting to know someone you should actually ask a question.  But with this feature, guys easily put out a statement (boring one) and don’t follow up with anything, making me the one to drive the conversation because “it’s my turn”.  \\nFor example, someone liked MY picture and I asked them a question, to which they replied, “amazing”.  So now it’s “my turn”...really?? I have like 7 conversations like this and I don’t have the time or energy to entertain these lazy guys.  \\n\\nDevelopers, please take that thing off!! It’s prob ok for the first two interactions, but it’s really giving the guys lazy excuses for the girls to lead.  No!!!!

The dopamine rush of getting a match is what keeps people coming back, and if this app was truly designed to help you find the one, they would rearrange the process so that matchmaking requires more effort than a simple like of a profile.

If I’m paying 50 a month, I should get UNLIMITED roses and you should be showing my profile way more, plus free boosts. 50 bucks a month and I still would have to pay for boosts and roses separately? Hinge is not designed to be deleted, it’s designed for you to keep forever while they drain your bank account.',\n",

I don’t get to choose.

If I force close the app and reopen, the same ones that played play and the ones that failed still fail. The bug is a shame because the ones I can hear are often exceptionally personal messages, that gives insight into people, let's you hear them, and represents putting way more of themselves out there.\", \"I've used the app for about a year off and on and it has some major flaws and technical issues. The voice prompts don't work half the time and worse, the messaging tab often never loads causing matches to think you ghosted them for a couple days when in fact the app prevented you from replying. Don't waste your time with this app as it is barely functional and will frustrate you more than anything.\", \"When I initially installed the app and set up my profile, I was unable to subscribe or communicate with anyone. I ultimately deleted my account, and only then a screen popped up confirming a ban has been instated. Edit: I was able to reach out to Hinge support and get that reversed, so I've raised the review score from one star to three. I remain very puzzled as to how and why a ban was placed and why communication around that in the app itself was so unclear.\", \"Hard to delete this app. Wish there was simply a canel button. Hard to get a hold of customer service as well. I've had to do this twice now where I do a stop payment at my bank to end the subscription. I do enjoy certain features of the app particularly where people can leave a voice clip on their profile. You can tell a lot about a person from their voice. I also like paying for the platform because men tend to be a lot more respectful.\", \"Signed up for 3 months for $60. Didn't think it was user friendly at all. Went on a couple dates where the people were nothing like there profile and decided I was done. Got on bank account the other day and saw they charged me another $60, I had no idea this was an auto renewal. Canceled immediately and requested a refund and was told NO even though it had only been 2 days. Total waste of money and poor customer service.\", \"The questions are different and fun. The mandatory photo and prompts for video are good. Verification of people is excellent feature to keep frauds out. Bad navigation and lack of intuitive icons. I comment and want to do more but the guy disappears after one click. Can't find their profiles again. Often I want to just pass over a guy for now but forced to either delete or match. Need an actual Match button! Only have heart and roses, forced to buy more roses can't send one. Text works.\", \"Format is terrible and cumbersome. Vertical and horizontal scrolling? Non-intuitive matching and no swiping? Not even a simple tutorial. It doesn't show what state your matches are in or the distance. Even the paid options are trash. This app used to be SO much better; did a high schooler develop this platform? No desktop functionality to read and respond without having to pick up the phone. Error linking to Instagram. Ugh, back to Bumble and Match... don't waste your money on this.\", \"The first night I started using this app, the messaging feature completely bugged out. The notifications would come thru, but they wouldn't show up in the chat. Then the chat stopped working all together. It wasn't a random glitch that quickly resolved. This started hours ago and hasn't gotten better. I tried everything from force closing to deleting and reinstalling. I won't be using again.\", 'Hinge is designed to be deleted because it\\'s designed not to work. Most profiles are low quality (bad pictures & little effort made). There is a feature called \"Standouts\" where the profiles have better pics and the prompts are filled out more thoughtfully. To have access to Standouts, you have to send them a rose in order to match. You only get 1 free rose a week. After you use it, you have to pay for more. I never match with anyone because they are fake profiles to trick you into paying.', 'Not much happening on this app. I paid for HingeX and did not notice any value for the extra money spent. They send you \"standout\" profiles and then want you to pay more money to be able to contact them. It feels like a total scam, and I regret wasting time and money that I can\\'t get back now. I think literally any other app would be a better choice. Caveat Emptor...', \"It's pretty good. So far I get to shoot my shot and fail, but at least they aren't chat bots and ai spamming false notifications to get me to pay for a subscription. It's crazy how certain FIRE ICON dating apps seem to make you pay for basic conversation and messaging. You'd think FREE messaging would make sense. A lot of women on here looking for something real. I am not good at socializing. So I guess being single forever is fine. Great app.\", \"I like the idea behind Hinge, but the app is held back by the servers it runs on. I've had it delete matches as soon as we match, refuse to load messages, never send messages, and only show my account to lesbian women before (there's a couple of obvious issues there.) It definitely seems less scummy than other apps, but the poor performance really knocks it down a peg.\", \"Re-downloaded this app after a few years. Man... Now I see why I deleted it! It's still trash. The interface and customization to your profile are better than other dating apps, but that doesn't matter when you have to pay for every. Single. Feature. On top of that, I get wayyy more matches on other apps, and I got 0 on this after a week! I wouldn't be surprised if half of these profiles were bots\", \"It's ok so far. There are not many users in my area, but that's just a location issue on my end. I prefer hinge over all the other apps so far. I like that you can like people by sending a short comment on a prompt, photo, or video. Although I've only got one reply so far. Haven't tried premium yet, so I can't say if it's worth it or not. I feel like if I lived in the city, I would be getting plenty of dates. Would recommend to friends over other dating apps!\", \"After much thought, I firmly believe this is the best dating app available right now. You don't have to pay to see who likes you, it's relatively easy to stay a conversation, the user base is mostly kept free of bots and inactive accounts, and it does the absolutely best job of recommending people to you that you might actually want to talk to of all the dating apps, IMHO. I do wish the premium features were somewhat reasonably priced, because they're currently prohibitively expensive.\", \"I like the system and this seems like one of the few legitimate dating apps there is. My only flaw is, it is expensive. $150 only for 6 months, even if you do basic your paying almost $100 just for 6 months. That's outrageous. Then $14 only for a week? Some places I know you pay that much for a month. It's a good app, but it's just too expensive if you want anything out of it. If it wasn't so expensive I'd give it more stars.\", 'Probably my favorite part of this app was downloading it, swiping two times, going to bed and waking up the next morning to be told my account was removed for violating terms of service. When all I had was a picture of my face, a generic bio, and hadn\\'t messaged anyone yet. My appeal was met with a \"You violated our terms of service\" and that was it. Terrible app. Terrible team. Terrible all around.', 'The matches tab/messaging feature refuses to load. It just keeps spinning and spinning and spinning. There\\'s no update to install, no \"we\\'re having trouble, refresh?\" Nothing. It would be great if this app let me do the thing I downloaded it for, talking to people. Everything else works great tho', \"ZERO STARS. STOLE MY MONEY. NOT WORTH IT. The concept of this app, while very similar to every other dating app, is a bit unique and that's cool. BUT....I had issues with profile verification, customer support couldn't solve it or take the time to understand that issue. Had to reinstall the app, lost entire profile, messages and matches. This time, no response from customer support. Only able to use for about a week and can't get a refund. Hinge customer support is AWFUL AND NOT HELPFUL.\", 'Half the functions to link accounts like instagram don\\'t work (get pushed into a feedback loop of the browser opening the app opening the browser opening the app) and photo verification does not work. \"Let\\'s try that again\" infinitely, despite having the crispest, cleanest lighting and photos my camera has ever taken live. I at least thought the app would function', \"Not any different from other dating apps, but with the caveat that you only get 5 swipes a day. The app does this to 'create more meaningful conversations', but starting a 'meaningful conversation' is no different from bugging or being bugged by people who haven't matched with you because it's just commenting on a person's profile. The app doesn't filter by country so if you live near the edge of one you will spend forever swiping through. No bios, only cringy prompts to choose from.\", \"Hides compatible matches behind paywall, scammy. Early COVID the algorithm was hitting. Match after match was attractive, would interact, would go on dates. Met some really great people pretty consistently. I was telling all of my friends to use it. Now I've been using it since January and any guy I would want to swipe on is behind the paywall with the stupid roses. Then when you run out of swipes, they will show you an attractive person to get you to buy one of their subscriptions.\", 'A huge weakness of this service is that it\\'s not accessible via computer. Meaningful conversation is hindered when you\\'re not willing to type out paragraphs on mobile, and when it\\'s still too early to give out a phone number or meet in person just yet. The messaging aspect of this app should be available on computer. It makes this app \"meant to be deleted\" from that frustration alone. Devs should consider.', 'I paid for a one month subscription for Hinge+. My experience hasn\\'t been great. I certainly didn\\'t see any more likes or matches. The biggest annoyance is that I swear that my likes are being hidden from me. I get notifications of likes, I click on the app to see them, and for a split second,I see the persons profile, and then it goes away. This happens all the time. If it\\'s a bug, fix it. But I believe this app and its \"algorithm\" is throttling its features. Nobody wants to make less money.', \"Pros: Lots of interesting and cool ppl on this app! Simple and easy to use! Cons: There's a pay wall just to be able to view everyone who has liked you and idk 15 dollars seems a bit much for a feature that really should be free imo. I also hate that you have to keep your bio short. I want to be able to write more than just a couple sentences per question/prompt in my bio!\", \"Since last 2 updates on Android I can't get the messages or potential matches to load , literally takes minutes if at all, constantly shows the thinking icon. I've force stopped and Uninstalled many times. Makes me want to stop using completely as well I rarely open it anymore because it's too frustrating to use. Absolutely horrible\", \"Overall looks clean and good. But on Android there's a weird bug when typing in a text field that would be below where the keyboard pops up, the screen doesn't resize or shift at all so you can't see what you're typing at all. I didn't know where to submit a bug so here ya go.\", \"Accidentally barely touched the top of my screen and Hinge removed my top match. It was someone I really liked. 1 star for having no feature to undo a mistake like that, as well as having a terrible interface that evidently makes it very easy to unmatch someone. Also no customer support. Garbage app, I'm so upset.\", 'so many fake profiles trying to get you to send them money on Whatsapp. the \"standout\" profiles are locked behind the super likes feature regardless if you purchased the subscription. they should give you more super likes each week if you subscribe. I purchased the highest subscription and ran out of potential matches, as soon as my subscription ran out, all these great new profiles came up. if you pay for the highest subscription, ALL the profiles should be available.', \"Update: Took time, but finally, customer service was able to help me. Thank you so much for your help. Did not like the app. Matching preferences were not accurate. Cancel subscription in the time frame specified in the terms and ask to get refunded, but customer service hasn't been great. No yet a refund or been contacted whatsoever. update Customer service contacted me, they have been emailing instructions over instructions, Still no refund.\", \"I like this app more than the other options, but it's broken. Wasn't getting message notifications and I had to reinstall just to see messages from my matches. Super buggy when switching back to it from another app and basically requires a relaunch. Wish you could comment on more things on someone's profile.\", \"Seems like a good app set up for relationships the girls are easier to talk to, better quality and you get more hits the only problem is is they have a limited inventory because they're not very big yet. But when you first go on you're going to do very well. You can leave free messages seems at least they're giving you a Fighting Chance left bumble was way too expensive\", \"I enjoy the community on this app and the effort people take to showcase themselves. Curating matches is done well and I was doubtful initially with how few likes I had compared to other apps. The UI for prompts and packaging a message with what you specifically like about someone is endearing. The rose system where people can only be sent them is a nice highlight reel. If my friends weren't already with someone I'd recommend it to them.\", \"The women do this weird thing where they don't reply to prompts, they will just match. So you actually have to send two messages before you get a response. Very peculiar. Hinge added a feature to indicate whose turn it is to message and yet they still don't. Also, hinge will give you tons of matches as long as you pay them. Otherwise good luck\", \"Photo verification is finicky and hardly ever works. Matches come in for maybe a month or two but trickle to near zero aftetwards. Typical, but it wasn't always like this. This used to be the app I would recommend along with bumble, but not anymore. Save your time and money, just go out to a bar.\", \"The algo is so obviously designed to work AGAINST users to increase engagement and add charges while intentionally NEVER helping you actually form a relationship. This is clear based on different people they show in conjunction w prompts asking for money. The more you use it the less you see people you'd be interested in unless you pay for additional features. It gets to know you then tries to keep you clicking and paying. It is NOT trying to help you meet someone.\", 'Worst dating app because 1) they verify you and claim to display an icon that you are verified, but there is no icon on any profiles, so people have no idea who is real and, 2) they recently removed easy video chatting feature so now only way for people to verify the other person is real is to ask for a phone number quickly in a conversation, which is uncomfortable for many. The combination of these 2 blunders has made the app an unusable piece of garbage.', \"I like this app, I do, however some changes would help, and I'm not sure how to implement such changes, primarily what I'm seeing is local to me women are anything but local, often times thousands of miles away. It's already frustrating enough finding the right person, this adds more challenges.\", 'Edit: Support is still garbage, app is less buggy. Had more dates w/bumble free vs paid Hinge. Started having major bugs with profiles showing up blank/vanishing, messages not going through, etc. I reached out to hinge & after a month w/ no reply I requested a refund from Google which they denied because it was past 48hrs. Hinge finally replied & told me to chargeback, so I did. I lost all access to the app features, but then Google fought the chargeback. So I paid 65$ for absolutely nothing.', 'For context: straight male, 33 yo,free version. Interface is easy to use, wish they would let you type more though. I used a variety of pics and prompts, was calculated in sending likes or roses and always sent a message with likes and usually and open ended question as well. Also all my prompts were open ended as well and put captions on all pics. got 2 total likes which neither said a word with the likes. No matches and obviously no messages. Hoped for more after that much time. Disappointing'], 'appId': 'co.hinge.app', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.hinge.app&hl=en&gl=us'}\n"
